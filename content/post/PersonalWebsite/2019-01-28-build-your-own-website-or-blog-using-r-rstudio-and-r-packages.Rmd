# Introduction

R enthusiasts are focused on developing packages and websites to promote their profile and share 
their knowledge to the world. Recently released packages such as blogdown, Rmarkdown, bookdown 
has played a significant amount of role in this popularity for R statistical software among 
generals users and academics in every field of statistics.

Due to this reason, I also wanted to develop my own R package to solve problem in hand and share
it with the rstats community. Even though Social Media is a strong way of sharing this amount of
information, it is not sturdy over time. To resolve this only I chose to develop my own website
using R and supportive tools from R. Your reading this post on my website which I developed in a 
very short period of time and have being maintaining regularly by posting articles. 

# Materials

I could have written an extensive and long article describing how I developed this website with 
screenshots and explanatory steps. As it should be a valuable experience I am only going
to give you the materials which were used with important points with facts. Further, I shall
give you certain specifics of my own website.
