<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>R enthusiasts are focused on developing packages and websites to promote their profile and share their knowledge to the world. Recently released packages such as blogdown, Rmarkdown, bookdown has played a significant amount of role in this popularity for R statistical software among generals users and academics in every field of statistics.</p>
<p>Due to this reason, I also wanted to develop my own R package to solve problem in hand and share it with the rstats community. Even though Social Media is a strong way of sharing this amount of information, it is not sturdy over time. To resolve this only I chose to develop my own website using R and supportive tools from R. Your reading this post on my website which I developed in a very short period of time and have being maintaining regularly by posting articles.</p>
