<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>R enthusiasts are focused on developing packages and websites to promote their profile and share their knowledge to the world. Recently released packages such as hugo, blogdown, Rmarkdown, bookdown has played a significant amount of role in this popularity for R statistical software among general users and academics in every field of statistics.</p>
<p>Due to this reason, I also wanted to develop my own R package to solve problem in hand and share it with the #rstats community. Even though Social Media is a strong way of sharing this amount of information, it is not sturdy over time. To resolve this only I chose to develop my own website using R and supportive tools from R. You are reading this post on my website which I developed in a very short period of time and have being maintaining regularly by posting articles.</p>

<div id="materials" class="section level1">

As it should be a valuable experience I am only going to give you the materials which were used with important points with facts. Further, I shall give you certain specifics of my own website.</p>

<h1>My Personal Website / Blog</h1>
<p>Information related to my website / blog will be discussed here. Mostly encouraging other people to make necessary changes in the original template to satisfy their curiosity and interest.</p>
<ul>
<li>I also used the academic theme but made alot of changes.</li>
<li>These changes include with a new css, color changing, font changing and others.</li>
<li>In the Home page I explored adding icons, heading names and changing the header successfully.</li>
<li>While writing blog posts I was able to learn inventive ways to make them interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now that is all I have done in related to developing my own website. It should be your own choice what you are going to develop, a website / blog. Mine is a website where articles are regularly posted. Further, it should be noted that the above materials were active when I was writing this post, therefore if it is not active do use google and try to find it.</p>
<p><em>THANK YOU</em></p>
