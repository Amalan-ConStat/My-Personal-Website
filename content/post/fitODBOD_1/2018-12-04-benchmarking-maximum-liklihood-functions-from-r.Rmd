# Estimating the shape parameters by Maximizing the Log Likelihood value of Beta-Binomial Distribution.

# Introduction 

When we need to estimate parameters from a discrete distribution or continuous distribution 
or a function we can use the below mentioned R functions. We will be using the technique of maximizing the 
Log Likelihood function or minimizing the Negative Log Likelihood function.  Based on 
this technique we will compare these R functions because it might benefit people who are struggling
which one to choose. We have 7 functions in total by my knowledge when I was writing this blog post. 

Using the [fitODBOD](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fitODBOD) package, I will use the Alcohol Consumption data to try 
and model it for the Beta-Binomial Distribution, which has two shape parameters to estimate. The process is that
we find values for shape parameters a and b (or $\alpha$ and $\beta$) which will maximize the Log 
Likelihood function of Beta Binomial Distribution or in our case minimize the Negative Log Likelihood 
function of Beta Binomial Distribution.

Above mentioned Beta-Binomial distribution's Probability Mass Function(PMF) is denoted as

$$P_{BetaBin}(x)= {n \choose x} \frac{B(\alpha+x,n+\beta-x)}{B(\alpha,\beta)} $$

where  $n=0,1,2,...$, $x=0,1,2,...,n$ and $\alpha,\beta > 0$. Further $x$ is the Binomial Random variable, 
a,b(or $\alpha$, $\beta$) are shape parameters and $n$ is the binomial trial value. Also B($\alpha$,$\beta$) 
is the Beta function. In this distribution we have to estimate the values for a and b. 

Further, using the PMF we can construct the Likelihood function for $\Omega_{BB}=(\alpha,\beta)^T$ as given below: 

$$L(\Omega_{BB}|x)=\prod_{i=1}^{N} \binom{n}{x_i} \frac{B(\alpha+x_i,n+\beta-x_i)}{B(\alpha,\beta)}$$

where N is the Number of observations. Then Negative Log Likelihood function is given as 

$$l(\Omega_{BB}|x)=-\sum_{i=1}^{N} log\binom{n}{x_i} + \sum_{i=1}^{N} log(B(\alpha+x_i,n+\beta-x_i)) - Nlog(B(\alpha,\beta))$$

In the package fitODBOD we have the function EstMLEBetaBin which is constructed based on the above 
Negative Log Likelihood function, and we will use it. 

We take Log to transform the Likelihood function values, which will simplify the 
computation process and save time. The optimization functions we need to compare will use specific 
mathematical methods to find the most appropriate shape parameter values.

The functions in question are 

1. [optim](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.5.1/topics/optim)
2. [nlm](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.5.1/topics/nlm)
3. [nlminb](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.5.1/topics/nlminb)
4. [ucminf](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ucminf/versions/1.1-4/topics/ucminf)
5. [maxLik](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/maxLik/versions/1.3-4/topics/maxLik)
6. [mle](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats4/versions/3.5.1/topics/mle)
7. [mle2](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/bbmle/versions/1.0.20/topics/mle2)

Further, I will focus on the attributes of the above functions. Focusing from which package, Number of Inputs, Number of Outputs, 
Time to complete optimization and Analytical Methods used with the assistance in two tables. Alcohol Consumption data 
has two sets of frequency values but only values from week 1 will be used. Below is the the Alcohol Consumption data, where number of observations
is 399 and the Binomial Random variable is a vector of values from zero to seven. 

```{r Data}
library(fitODBOD)
kable(Alcohol_data,"html",align=c('c','c','c')) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped"),font_size = 14,full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0,color = "blue") %>%
  column_spec(1,color = "red")
```

## optim Function

[optim](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/00Index.html#O) is the first function in concern.
[Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.5.1/topics/optim) 
of the optim function is useful and it indicates that this function is only used on one input situations only. This means our 
EstMLEBetaBin function has to be modified. Reason for this is only the parameters that should be estimated need to be input values
but our EstMLEBetaBin function has four parameters which are a,b,x(Binomial Random Variable) and freq(corresponding frequency values). 

While using optim function first index refers to shape parameter a and second index refers to shape parameter b. Further, we have 
to input the observations or in our case the Binomial random variable values and their respective frequencies. I think it
is inconvenient to modify the EstMLEBetaBin function, because if we want to estimate parameters for different data-sets it would 
become tedious. After modification we have a new function foroptim which can be used for demonstration and comparison.

Below is the code to estimation and going through the outputs. It should be noted that we have to provide 
initial parameter values as an input to the optim function, and it is best to provide values in the domain of  
shape parameter values which we want to estimate. 

Here the shape parameters a and b are in the region of greater than zero but less than positive infinity($+\infty >a,b>0$). 
So for the initial parameters of a=0.1 and b=0.2 we are finding parameters which would minimize the Negative
Log Likelihood function of Beta-Binomial distribution with the Alcohol Consumption data.

```{r optim function from stats package,results='hide'}
# new function to facilitate optim criteria
# only one input but has two elements
foroptim<-function(a)
  {
  EstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days, freq=Alcohol_data$week1,a=a[1],b=a[2])
  }

# optimizing values for a,b using default mathematical method
optim_answer<-optim(par=c(0.1,0.2),fn=foroptim)

# obtaining class of output
class(optim_answer)

#length of output
length(optim_answer)

# the outputs
optim_answer$par # estimated values for a, b
optim_answer$value # minimized function value 
optim_answer$counts  # see the documentation to understand
optim_answer$convergence # indicates successful completion
optim_answer$message # additional information

# fitting the Beta-Binomial distribution with estimated shape parameter  values
fitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,
           optim_answer$par[1],optim_answer$par[2])
```

So the foroptim function can be used as above and parameters are estimated for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (or a, b) for the Alcohol Consumption 
data week 1. Further we have scrutinized the function as below.

* package : stats 
* No of Inputs: 7
* Minimum required Inputs : 2
* Class of output : list
* No of outputs: 5
* No of Analytical Methods : 6
* Default Method : Nelder-Mead

## nlm Function

[nlm](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/00Index.html#N) function is also similar to optim 
but only one analytical method will be used, which is a Newton-type Algorithm. 
Here also there needs to be changes made to our EstMLEBetaBin function as previously. After making those changes 
we have called the new Negative Log-likelihood function of Beta-Binomial distribution as fornlm. Then we can use the nlm function and estimate 
a and b for the initial shape parameter values of 0.1 and 0.2 respectively. 
[Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.5.1/topics/nlm) 
of nlm function is very useful so that we can understand how it works.

Below is the code for using nlm function appropriately and fiddling with the results.

```{r nlm function from stats package,results='hide'}
#new function to facilitate nlm criteria
fornlm<-function(a)
  {
  EstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days, freq=Alcohol_data$week1,a=a[1],a[2])
  }

#optimizing values for a,b using the only analytical method
nlm_answer<-nlm(f=fornlm,p=c(0.1,0.2))

#obtaining class of output
class(nlm_answer)

#length of output
length(nlm_answer)

# the outputs
nlm_answer$estimate # estimated values for a, b
nlm_answer$minimum # minimized function value 
nlm_answer$gradient  # gradient at the estimated minimum of given funciton
nlm_answer$code # indicates successful completion
nlm_answer$iterations # number of iterations performed

# fitting the Beta-Binomial distribution with estimated shape parameter  values
fitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,
           nlm_answer$estimate[1],nlm_answer$estimate[2])
```

Similarly for the fornlm function we have estimated values for a and b which would fit the Alcohol consumption data
of week 1. Below is a point form summary of nlm function.

* package : stats 
* No of Inputs: 12
* Minimum required Inputs : 2
* Class of output : list
* No of outputs: 5
* No of Analytical Methods : 1
* Default Method : Newton-type Algorithm

## nlminb Function

[nlminb](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/00Index.html#N) is also similar and 
requires the EstMLEBetaBin function to be restructured as similar to previous situations. 
After this task we now have a function called fornlminb. nlminb function is based on analytical method of 
unconstrained and box-constrained optimization using PORT routines.

After choosing initial parameter values for a and b, which are respectively 0.1 and 0.2 the estimation was done 
following the process below

```{r nlminb function from stats package, results='hide'}
# new function to facilitate nlminb criteria
fornlminb<-function(a)
  {
  EstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days, freq=Alcohol_data$week1,a=a[1],a[2])
}

# optimizing values for a,b using default analytical method
nlminb_answer<-nlminb(start=c(0.1,0.2), objective=fornlminb)

# obtaining class of output
class(nlminb_answer)

# length of output
length(nlminb_answer)

# the outputs
nlminb_answer$par # estimated values for a, b
nlminb_answer$objective # minimized function value 
nlminb_answer$evaluations  # see the documentation to understand
nlminb_answer$convergence # indicates successful completion
nlminb_answer$message # additional information
nlminb_answer$iterations # number of iterations performed

# fitting the Beta-Binomial distribution with estimated shape parameter values
fitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,
           nlminb_answer$par[1],nlminb_answer$par[2])
```

[Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.5.1/topics/nlminb) 
includes the information related to the function therefore referring it will 
be useful. After estimating values for a and b using nlminb function these were noticed regarding
the function in concern

* package : stats 
* No of Inputs: 8
* Minimum required Inputs : 2
* Class of output : list
* No of outputs: 6
* No of Analytical Methods : 1
* Default Method : Unconstrained and box-constrained optimization using PORT routines

## ucminf Function

Package [uncminf](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ucminf) produces the ucminf function, as previously mentioned functions here also
we have to change the EstMLEBetaBin function. After making the changes we will be using the
forucminf function to the estimation process of shape parameters a and b. 

When initial parameter values are set to a=0.1 and b=0.2 we will obtain results from 
ucminf function, which will minimize the Negative Log-likelihood value of Beta-Binomial distribution.
Below is the code for estimation and using the results to understand the function ucminf.

```{r ucminf function from stats package, results='hide'}
library(ucminf)

# new function to facilitate ucminf criteria
forucminf<-function(a)
  {
  EstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days,freq = Alcohol_data$week1,a=a[1],a[2])
}

# optimizing values for a,b using default analytical method
ucminf_answer<-ucminf(par=c(0.1,0.2),fn=forucminf)

#obtaining class
class(ucminf_answer)

# length of output
length(ucminf_answer)

# the outputs
ucminf_answer$par # estimated values for a, b
ucminf_answer$value # minimized function value 
ucminf_answer$invhessian.lt  # see the documentation understand
ucminf_answer$convergence # indicates successful completion
ucminf_answer$message # additional information
ucminf_answer$info

# fitting the Beta-Binomial distribution with estimated shape parameter values
fitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,
           ucminf_answer$par[1],ucminf_answer$par[2])
```

With the help of R [Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ucminf/versions/1.1-4/topics/ucminf) the 
estimation was done for shape parameter values a and b using the ucminf function. Below is the initial understanding of
the ucminf function 

* package : ucminf
* No of Inputs: 5
* Minimum required Inputs : 2
* Class of output : list
* No of outputs: 6
* No of Analytical Methods : 1
* Default Method : Quasi-Newton Algorithm type with BFGS updating

## maxLik Function

maxLik function is from the [maxLik](https://cran.r-project.org/package=maxLik) package, which only 
maximizes the Log Likelihood function. Therefore we have to restructure EstMLEBetaBin as previously mentioned, but as 
an addition a negative sign is added for the output. This new function will be called as formaxLik. 

For the initial parameter values where a=0.1 and b=0.2 the maxLik function will be used and 
results will be evaluated as below. 

```{r maxLik function from maxLik package, results='hide'}
library(maxLik)

# new function to facilitate maxLik criteria
formaxLik<-function(a)
  {
  -EstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days,freq = Alcohol_data$week1,a=a[1],a[2])
  }

# optimizing values for a,b using default analytical method
maxLik_answer<-maxLik(logLik =formaxLik, start = c(0.1,0.2))

# obtaining class of output
class(maxLik_answer)

# length of output
length(maxLik_answer)

# the outputs
maxLik_answer$estimate # estimated values for a, b
maxLik_answer$maximum # minimized function value 
maxLik_answer$iterations  # no of iterations to succeed
maxLik_answer$gradient # last gradient value which was calculated
maxLik_answer$message # additional information
maxLik_answer$hessian # hessian matrix
maxLik_answer$code # indicates successful completion
maxLik_answer$fixed # logical vector indicating which parameters are constants
maxLik_answer$type # type of maximization
maxLik_answer$last.step # list describing the last unsuccessful step
maxLik_answer$control # see the documentation understand

# fitting the Beta-Binomial distribution with estimated shape parameter values
fitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,
           maxLik_answer$estimate[1],maxLik_answer$estimate[2])
```

Using the [Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/maxLik/versions/1.3-4/topics/maxLik) of maxLik
and the [Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/maxLik/versions/1.3-4/topics/maxNR) of 
maxNR function the above analysis was done for the maxLik function. According to the above code, below are the findings from the maxLik 
function in point form 

* package : maxLik
* No of Inputs: 6
* Minimum required Inputs : 2
* Class of output : list or class of maxim or class of maxLik
* No of outputs: 11
* No of Analytical Methods : 7
* Default Method : Automatically chosen

## mle Function

[stats4](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats4/html/00Index.html) package is installed so that mle function can be operated for the purpose of 
estimating a and b parameters. Here also as previously we need to make some changes 
as below and create a new Negative Log Likelihood function called formle. 

For the initial parameter values of a=0.1 and b=0.2 the Negative Log Likelihood value of Beta-Binomial distribution
has been minimized using mle function. Below is the code for estimation and investigation
from the outputs of mle after estimation. 

```{r mle function from stats4 package, results='hide'}
library(stats4)

# new function to facilitate mle criteria
formle<-function(a,b)
  {
  EstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days,freq = Alcohol_data$week1,a,b)
  }

# optimizing values for a,b using default analytical method
mle_answer<-mle(minuslogl=formle,start = list(a=0.1,b=0.2))

# obtaining class
class(mle_answer)

# length of output
length(mle_answer)

# the outputs
mle_answer@call # inputs i have used 
mle_answer@coef # estimated values for a,b
mle_answer@fullcoef # all values, even the fixed values we did not want to estimate
mle_answer@vcov # variance covariance matrix for a,b

mle_answer@nobs # number of observations to be used for computing only if given 
mle_answer@method # optimization methods used

# Methods used

# fitting the Beta-Binomial distribution with estimated shape parameter values
fitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,
           mle_answer@coef[1],mle_answer@coef[2])
```

It should be noted that in all 5 previous functions we had only outputs in the form of lists, but
through mle we are seeing a class of mle output.The [Documention](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats4/versions/3.5.1/topics/mle) 
explains the inputs and outputs of mle. [Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats4/versions/3.5.1/topics/mle-class) 
for mle-class explains further about the methods that can be used. Below is a list of findings 
based on the outputs of the mle function.

* package : stats4
* No of Inputs: 5
* Minimum required Inputs : 2
* Class of output : class of mle
* No of outputs: 9
* Methods for output: 8 
* No of Analytical Methods :6
* Default Method : Nelder and Mead

## mle2 Function

mle2 function is advanced than mle function and it is from the package [bbmle](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bbmle). 
Here, there is no need to modify the EstMLEBetabin function from the fitODBOD package 
to estimation as all previous situations . 

For the initial parameter values of a=0.1 and b=0.2 Negative Log Likelihood function of Beta-Binomial distribution will be
minimized where outputs will be investigated and methods related to output of class mle2 will be used.

Below is the code for using mle2 function and scrutinizing the output and methods 
related to it. 

```{r mle2 function from bbmle package, results='hide'}
library(bbmle)

# optimizing values for a,b using default analytical method
mle2_answer<-mle2(minuslogl= EstMLEBetaBin,start = list(a=0.1,b=0.2),
                  data = list(x=Alcohol_data$Days,freq=Alcohol_data$week1))

# Summary of the seven optimization functions in R 

After completing a brief fact finding of the R functions optim, nlm, nlminb, ucminf, 
maxLik, mle and mle2. We can record the facts and results in two tables. Using them
we can choose the best suitable function for our needs of estimation from optimization.

Mostly I prefer mle2 function than others because it provides special methods to handle
the mle2 outputs, and the output themselves are very thorough than other R function outputs. 

It can be seen that estimated a and b shape parameter values are different only 
from the third decimal point in all outputs. But this does not effect the 
minimized Negative Log Likelihood value of Beta-Binomial distribution for our Alcohol
Consumption data, which is same for all outputs.

# Summary of Time evaluation for the seven optimization R functions

Further at the beginning I have mentioned to evaluate the system process time 
for the seven functions. In order to do this time comparison it is possible to use the [benchmark](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rbenchmark/versions/1.0.0/topics/benchmark) 
function of [rbenchmark](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rbenchmark) 
package, and below mentioned code chunk provides the output in a table form. 
It includes the functions and their respective time values. The estimation 
process of the parameters where each function has been replicated 1000 times to receive a
more accurate table of time values. 

The table is in ascending order according to the elapsed time values column. According to this we 
can see that least time takes to the nlminb function and most time is taken to the mle2 function. These 
times completely depends on the Negative Log Likelihood function you need to minimize, the data you provided,
the number of estimators that needs to be estimated, the complexity of the function and finally your computer's 
processing power. 

Therefore based on the needs of your output and the function which needs estimation choose the best function out of the above seven.
Because as I said related to the earlier table the estimated values are slightly different but does not make any strong influence 
on the results.

```{r time benchmark}
library(rbenchmark)

Results2<-benchmark(
          "optim"={optim(par = c(0.1,0.2), fn = foroptim)},
          "nlm"={nlm(f = fornlm, p = c(0.1,0.2))},

# Summary of Results after estimating parameters using the optimization R functions

After using the functions optim, nlm, nlminb, ucminf, maxLik, mle and mle2 to estimate
the shape parameters a, b we can use the estimated parameters in the function fitBetaBin.
Using this function we can find expected frequencies for each of the estimated parameters a,b and 
compare p-values and over-dispersion and understand if using different optimization functions had
any effect on them.

According to the below table there is no significant changes between the expected frequencies,
p-values or the over dispersion values. This is a clear indication that it does not matter what function we
use for the optimization. Because the process will occur effectively only efficiency(time) will be affected.

```{r Summary of Results,echo=FALSE}
Results3<-data.frame(
BinomialRandomVariable=c("0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","Total No of Observations","p-value","Over Dispersion"),

                  )

kable(Results3,"html",align = c('c','c','c','c','c','c','c','c')) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F,bootstrap_options = c("striped"),font_size = 10) %>%
  row_spec(0,color = "blue") %>%
  column_spec(1,color = "red")

```

# Final Conclusion

We had 7 functions to compare but choosing one over the other is completely harmless
to the final result of estimation as seen by our tables. The only issue is time, therefore
I would recommend choose the best function based on your needs of output and research objective.
