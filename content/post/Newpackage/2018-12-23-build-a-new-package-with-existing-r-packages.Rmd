# Introduction

Package development is a sense of accomplishment for any statistical programmer who needs self
satisfaction. I developed the R package [fitODBOD]()
for the purpose of fitting Over dispersed Binomial Outcome Data using Binomial Mixture 
Distributions and Alternate Binomial Distributions. It was a an amazing journey learning how 
to develop an R package, which took me around 6 months while understanding the theoretical
aspects of my research project and doing my 4th year courses. 

I am still learning new things related to R, which is helpful for this R package development.
Making package version updates regularly is for the benefit of the user. I have learned new ways
to express the theoretical concepts in the simplest form of functions, classes and methods. Currently,
I am exploring the possibility of using Rshiny dashboard and GUI. 

In the beginning, R package developers have used manual techniques (which mean difficult techniques)  
to develop R functions, documentation and examples for their packages. Over time it has changed rapidly,
where currently we are using R packages to develop our own R package. In this post I shall briefly 
mention these packages which you can use. Using these packages it is possible to make package development
stress free, time efficient and objective effective. Simultaneously we can make our R packages more attractive
for the users, which would lead to lot of attention in the R community.

There are three types of packages in my perspective, first "Most Essential Packages" which cannot be 
ignored, second "Essential packages" it is your choice to ignore and finally, "Still I have not Used" packages.

# Most Essential Packages

There are three packages in my main interest list and they are [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools),
[roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) and [testhat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat).

## devtools

Collection of packages which would significantly help the package development 
process. Functions such as dev_mode, check_failures, check_win and check_man.

[Link for the package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools)

### pkgbuild

Locates compilers needed to build R packages on various platforms.

[Link for the package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkgbuild)

### pkgload

Simulate the process of installing a package and then attacking it.

[Link for the package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkgload)

### rcmdcheck 

Run "R CMD check" from R programmaticallly, and capture the results
of the individual checks.

[Link for the package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rcmdcheck)

### usethis

Automating few tasks related to package building.

[Link for the package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=usethis)

## roxygen2

Generate Rd documentation, and Namespace file with simplicity
which would save time, when package update occurs.

[Link for the package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2)

### knitr 

Useful to develop vignettes related to R package development.

[Link for the package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr)

### markdown, rmarkdown, rmdformats

Html formats to vignettes in R package development and special template
styles for the vignettes.

[markdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=markdown) [rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown) [rmdformats](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmdformats)

### spelling

Checking for spelling issues in Rd documentation files.

[Link for the package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=spelling)

### trackmd

Tracking changes in markdown files for vignette.

[Link for the package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/trackmd)

## testthat

Checking if functions work properly by testing them in 
multiple ways for errors, outputs and inputs.

[Link for the package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat)

# Essential Packages

We would not necessarily need these packages to develop our package, but
it would make things more official if we choose to use them. Creating official badges,
using GitHub for version control, checking for code coverage, distinct logo and having a website
to explore the functions and vignettes of the package. 

## git2r and gh

Access to GitHub so that version control would occur smoothly with integration in Rstudio.

[git2r](https://cran.r-project.org/package=git2r) [gh](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gh)

## desc 

Editing the Description file using package rather than manually editing the file.

[Link to package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=desc)

## covr

Checking code coverage, which means does all functions have examples and are there tests for
error messages, etc.

[Link to package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=covr)

## badgecreatr and badger

Adding badges to GitHub repository, for example Download, CRAN status, code coverage, 
Release date, version and much more.

[badgecreatr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=badgecreatr) [badger](https://cran.r-project.org/package=badger)

## hexSticker

Creating a hexagon sticker for your package. Mostly just for the fun, but in a while its like
promoting a brand.

[Link to package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=hexSticker)

## pkgdown

Using man files, vignette of your package to develop a static website. Further, it is possible to
promote this site to get more people interested in the package.

[Link to package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkgdown)

#  Still I have not Used

In this list I will explore packages which can be used to make package development
more simple and elegant. Mostly using functions for the tasks of proper code spaces, indent
and necessary R versions of dependency packages.

## packrat

Manage the R packages in an isolated, portable and reproducible way.

[Link to package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=packrat)

## pkgconfig

Set configuration options on a per-package basis. 

[Link to package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkgconfig)

## pkginspector

Understand internal structure of an R package.

[Link to package](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/pkginspector)

## rvcheck

Check latest release version of R and R packages.

[Link to package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rvcheck)

## rversions

Focusing on R version 'r-release' and 'r-oldrel'. Further all previous R versions.

[Link to package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rversions)

## formatR

Spaces and Indent for the code automatically added

[Link to package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=formatR)

## whoami

Username and full-name of current user, also email address and GitHub username.

[Link to package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=whoami)

# Conclusion

Hopefully we would have more packages and awareness towards R package development
with more simplicity in the coming years. Even though we have more than 15,000 packages 
in CRAN it would still rapidly increase in the coming years, not only in CRAN but also in 
GitHub as well. 

So far this post has only word content and links, therefore I am adding a screenshot of my 
fitODBOD package GitHub package ReadME.md file. This screen shot includes badges for downloads,
R version, published date, package version and a hexagon logo sticker.

I hope this blog post is useful for anyone who has intentions to develop their R package or 
in the process of development or version controlling. I developed fitODBOD as a research
project for my final year and it included a thesis report as well. Over time I wrote a 
Journal article as well and it is still under review. Also I have seen R package development
as a PhD submission as well. Therefore it would be worthwhile developing an R package as a way 
to keep an active status regarding your field of interest in Statistics.
