<h1>What I am going to do and Why ?</h1>
<p>Sri Lanka will face a presidential election by the end of this year, but in order to understand how people
have voted so far in previous elections we need data. I was hoping this data could be in
<a href="http://www.data.gov.lk/search/type/dataset?query=election">opendata</a> initiative website, unfortunately i
was not happy with the results. Only one set of data was presented here, which was for District Registered
Electors from 2007 - 2017.</p>
<p>Well I did not give up, because there is the Election Commission website. Hopefully, I found the data which
was needed under the title
<a href="https://elections.gov.lk/web/en/elections/elections-results/presidential-elections-results/">Presidential Election Results.</a>
Still there is an issue where all the election results are in pdf files. Each pdf file had data of each presidential election.
After skimming through these six election results in pdf files it was clear that not all of them have the same
format or pattern in representing the data. But this will not be an issue if we had the data in a csv or excel file
which could be useful for researchers or investigative journalists.</p>
<p>So my knowledge as an R programmer will come in handy in extracting tables from these pdfs. Also this blog post is
about extracting data from the pdf file of Presidential Election results of 2015. I will be using packages <em>pdftools</em>,
<em>stringr</em>, <em>data.table</em> and <em>splitstackshape</em>.</p>
