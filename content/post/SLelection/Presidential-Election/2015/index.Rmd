# What I am going to do and Why ?

Sri Lanka will face a presidential election by the end of this year, but in order to understand how people 
have voted so far in previous elections we need data. I was hoping this data could be in 
[opendata](http://www.data.gov.lk/search/type/dataset?query=election) initiative website, unfortunately I
was not happy with the results. Only one set of data was presented here, which was for District Registered 
Electors from 2007 - 2017. 

## Where is the data !

Well I did not give up, because there is the Elections Commission website. Hopefully, I found the data which 
was needed under the title 
[Presidential Election Results.](https://elections.gov.lk/web/en/elections/elections-results/presidential-elections-results/)
Still there is an issue where all the election results are in pdf files. Each pdf file had data of each presidential election.
After skimming through these six election results in pdf files it was clear that not all of them have the same 
format or pattern in representing the data. But this will not be an issue if we had the data in a csv or excel file
which could be useful for researchers or investigative journalists.

So my knowledge as an R programmer will come in handy for extracting tables from these pdfs. Also this blog post is 
about extracting data from the pdf file of Presidential Election results in 2015. I will be using the packages *pdftools*,
*stringr*, *data.table* and *splitstackshape*.  

# Simplifying and Solving

*pdftools* to extract information from pdf files, *stringr* for string manipulation such as identify, remove or match
patterns, *data.table* to create the data-set, finally *splitstackshape* for critical column and row manipulation using 
patterns in text. These packages are much useful in creating one strong data-set of Presidential Election results from 
year 2015.

In a presidential election all contestants are voted from all electorates through out the country, therefore in all
tables the information looks the same. This same type of information is the contestants names, valid votes, rejected votes,
total polled and registered electors. So extracting data is much more easier in a presidential election than a parliament
election. This year 2015 presidential election pdf file of 111 pages can be classified in-to three groups based on pages.

First group includes pages 1 and 111 where no data needs to be extracted. Second group is for pages which has only one table,
Final group is with pages which have two tables per page(which is a lot). Small note is that a new district result begins in
a new page that is why we have pages with one table. It should be noted that in this pdf file the results tables are divided
by district wise. Main heading is district name, secondary heading is Electorate name for each table, this is not the case
for all tables. There are three types of tables, which are tables for electorate votes, district postal votes and final
district results. Below are figures of proof.

So from these tables only we need to extract information and create one large data-set. 

# Programming Part

I shall divide the data extraction in-to two parts, first extract data from two table pages and next
extract data from one table pages. For these two situations I will develop two functions. Both functions
are similar except for the part with number of tables. 

I shall only discuss the two table situation here(but will include code for one table extraction). 

## Step 1

Extract two tables based on the lines, such lines are created by splitting the one large character 
data using the pattern "\n". Using the pdf_text function on the pdf file we will produce a data-frame
where each page is represented by a list(so 111 lists). Using str_split function we can create a data-frame
where each line is for a row. So for the first table the information is from line 4 to 26 and second table
data is from line 29 to 51. 

```{r Step 1 load the packages and file}
# load the packages 
library(pdftools)
library(stringr)
library(splitstackshape)
library(data.table)

# load the file 
SL_PE_2015<-pdf_text("PresidentialElections2015.pdf")

page<-2

# split the one large list into a data frame of lines and separate them into two tables
table1<-data.table(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][4:26])
table2<-data.table(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][29:51])

# name the only column in these two data tables
names(table1)<-"hello"
names(table2)<-"hello"
```

![](/SLelection/2015/Step1.JPG)

Now we have two one column data-frames.

## Step 2 

First column in these two tables contain the same information as mentioned earlier. So after removing
this information we will be limited to a one column data-frame with votes and percentage values only. 
This one column table can be separated by column splitting based on the pattern " ". 

```{r Step 2}
# creating the list with same type of information
Names=c("Aithurus Mohamed Illias","Ibrahim Miflar","Prasanna Priyankara",
        "Wimal Geeganage","Sirithunga Jayasuriya","M. B. Theminimulla",
        "Pani Wijesiriwardane","Duminda Nagamuwa",
        "Panagoda Don Prince Soloman Anura Liyanage",
        "Maithripala Sirisena","Ruwanthilaka Peduru Arachchi",
        "Anuruddha Polgampala","Baththaramulle Seelarathana Thero",
        "Sarath Manamendra","Arachchige Rathnayaka Sirisena",
        "Mahinda Rajapaksa","Namal Rajapaksa","Sundaram Mahendran",
        "Jayantha Kulathunga","Valid Votes","Rejected Votes",
        "Total Polled","Regis.Electors")

# first using the above list remove the first column info
# then split all rows of one column into two columns based on " " pattern
Top<-cSplit(lapply(table1, function(x) str_remove(x,Names)),"hello"," ")
Bottom<-cSplit(lapply(table2, function(x) str_remove(x,Names)),"hello"," ")

# Extract the information of sub heading above each table by removing the pattern "\r"
Name1<-str_remove(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][2],"\r")
Name2<-str_remove(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][27],"\r")
```

![](/SLelection/2015/Step2.JPG)

## Step 3

Now create a proper table with three columns which has that same type of information, votes(with commas) and percentages
(with percentage sign). Well by creating these Top1 and Bottom1 tables we will remove the percentage sign. Then 
we will remove the commas(,) in votes columns and convert them into numeric class. Further, even though the percentage 
column looks numeric it is not. To resolve it we shall convert these values also from factor to character and then finally 
to numeric. 

```{r Step 3}
# creating the new dataset with three columns without percentage sign
Top1<-data.table("ColumnNames"=Names,"Votes"=Top$hello_1,"Percentage"=str_remove(Top$hello_2,"%"))
Bottom1<-data.table("ColumnNames"=Names,"Votes"=Bottom$hello_1,"Percentage"=str_remove(Bottom$hello_2,"%"))

# remove the commas from votes column and convert them to numeric class
Top1[,2] <- lapply(Top1[,2], function(x) as.numeric(as.character(str_remove_all(x,","))))
Bottom1[,2] <- lapply(Bottom1[,2], function(x) as.numeric(as.character(str_remove_all(x,","))))

# convert the percentage values to numeric class
Top1[,3]<-lapply(Top1[,3], function(x) as.numeric(as.character(x)))
Bottom1[,3]<-lapply(Bottom1[,3], function(x) as.numeric(as.character(x)))
```

![](/SLelection/2015/Step3.JPG)

## Step 4

Now our final tables are prepared. We shall name the columns. First column is for year,
second column is for district name, third column is for that same type of information,
fourth column is for number of votes and final column is for the percentage values.

```{r Step 4}
Electorate1<-data.table("Year"=2015,
                        "District"=str_remove(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][1],
                                                          " Districts Results\r"), 
                        "Electorate"=Name1,"ColNames"=Top1$ColumnNames,"Votes"=Top1$Votes,
                        "Percentage"=Top1$Percentage)
Electorate2<-data.table("Year"=2015,
                        "District"=str_remove(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][1],
                                                          " Districts Results\r"),
                        "Electorate"=Name2,"ColNames"=Bottom1$ColumnNames,"Votes"=Bottom1$Votes,
                        "Percentage"=Bottom1$Percentage)
```

Finally, we have extracted two clear tables under the name Electorate1 and Electorate2. First three table types 
mentioned above can be extracted now.

# One Complete Function

Combining the above 4 steps we can create one function where the input is page number and the resultant
will be a data-table of one page information but of two tables as below. 

```{r Extracting two tables from all pages which has two tables}
Extract_twotable<-function(page)
{
table1<-data.table(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][4:26])
table2<-data.table(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][29:51])

names(table1)<-"hello"
names(table2)<-"hello"

Names=c("Aithurus Mohamed Illias","Ibrahim Miflar","Prasanna Priyankara",
        "Wimal Geeganage","Sirithunga Jayasuriya","M. B. Theminimulla",
        "Pani Wijesiriwardane","Duminda Nagamuwa",
        "Panagoda Don Prince Soloman Anura Liyanage",
        "Maithripala Sirisena","Ruwanthilaka Peduru Arachchi",
        "Anuruddha Polgampala","Baththaramulle Seelarathana Thero",
        "Sarath Manamendra","Arachchige Rathnayaka Sirisena",
        "Mahinda Rajapaksa","Namal Rajapaksa","Sundaram Mahendran",
        "Jayantha Kulathunga","Valid Votes","Rejected Votes",
        "Total Polled","Regis.Electors")

Top<-cSplit(lapply(table1, function(x) str_remove(x,Names)),"hello"," ")
Bottom<-cSplit(lapply(table2, function(x) str_remove(x,Names)),"hello"," ")

Name1<-str_remove(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][2],"\r")
Name2<-str_remove(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][27],"\r")

Top1<-data.table("ColumnNames"=Names,"Votes"=Top$hello_1,"Percentage"=str_remove(Top$hello_2,"%"))
Bottom1<-data.table("ColumnNames"=Names,"Votes"=Bottom$hello_1,"Percentage"=str_remove(Bottom$hello_2,"%"))

Top1[,2] <- lapply(Top1[,2], function(x) as.numeric(as.character(str_remove_all(x,","))))
Bottom1[,2] <- lapply(Bottom1[,2], function(x) as.numeric(as.character(str_remove_all(x,","))))

Top1[,3]<-lapply(Top1[,3], function(x) as.numeric(as.character(x)))
Bottom1[,3]<-lapply(Bottom1[,3], function(x) as.numeric(as.character(x)))

Electorate1<-data.table("Year"=2015,
                        "District"=str_remove(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][1],
                                                          " Districts Results\r"), 
                        "Electorate"=Name1,"ColNames"=Top1$ColumnNames,"Votes"=Top1$Votes,
                        "Percentage"=Top1$Percentage)
Electorate2<-data.table("Year"=2015,
                        "District"=str_remove(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][1],
                                                          " Districts Results\r"),
                        "Electorate"=Name2,"ColNames"=Bottom1$ColumnNames,"Votes"=Bottom1$Votes,
                        "Percentage"=Bottom1$Percentage)

output<-rbind2(Electorate1,Electorate2)

return(output)
}
```

After developing such function and naming it as *Extract_twotable(page)*, it now possible to extract
data from more than 75 pages in the Presidential election 2015 pdf file. 

# Using the One Function to extract Data from Multiple pages

In order to do the above extraction first we have to identify the pages which have only
one table and then deselect them. After this with the help of a for loop we can create 
a long list of elements. Where each element is a table, and that table is from one page.
Below is the code for that solution.

```{r extracting pages with two tables,warning=FALSE}
# page numbers from 1 to 111
pages<-c(1:111)

# removing pages with only one tables
pages<-pages[-c(1,10,18,31,48,58,61,64,70,82,87,90,96,99,110,111)]

# creating a empty data-frame
datas<-NULL

# creating the large data frame after extracting two tables 
for (i in pages) 
        {
        # two tables of each page is considered as a list element
        datas[[i]]<-Extract_twotable(i)        
        }

# combining the multiple list data-frame as one data-frame
out1<-do.call("rbind",datas)
```

![](/SLelection/2015/output1.JPG)

After this large extraction similarly we have to write a function for one table pages 
also. Below is the code chunk for that. Here we create a function called *Extract_onetable(page)*
similar as before where the input is page-number. 

```{r one table page extraction}
Extract_onetable<-function(page)
{
table1<-data.table(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][4:26])

names(table1)<-"hello"

Names=c("Aithurus Mohamed Illias","Ibrahim Miflar","Prasanna Priyankara",
        "Wimal Geeganage","Sirithunga Jayasuriya","M. B. Theminimulla",
        "Pani Wijesiriwardane","Duminda Nagamuwa",
        "Panagoda Don Prince Soloman Anura Liyanage",
        "Maithripala Sirisena","Ruwanthilaka Peduru Arachchi",
        "Anuruddha Polgampala","Baththaramulle Seelarathana Thero",
        "Sarath Manamendra","Arachchige Rathnayaka Sirisena",
        "Mahinda Rajapaksa","Namal Rajapaksa","Sundaram Mahendran",
        "Jayantha Kulathunga","Valid Votes","Rejected Votes",
        "Total Polled","Regis.Electors")

Top<-cSplit(lapply(table1, function(x) str_remove(x,Names)),"hello"," ")

Name1<-str_remove(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][2],"\r")

Top1<-data.table("ColumnNames"=Names,"Votes"=Top$hello_1,"Percentage"=str_remove(Top$hello_2,"%"))

Top1[,2] <- lapply(Top1[,2], function(x) as.numeric(as.character(str_remove_all(x,","))))

Top1[,3]<-lapply(Top1[,3], function(x) as.numeric(as.character(x)))

Electorate1<-data.table("Year"=2015,
                        "District"=str_remove(str_split(SL_PE_2015[[page]],"\n")[[1]][1],
                                                          " Districts Results\r"), 
                        "Electorate"=Name1,"ColNames"=Top1$ColumnNames,"Votes"=Top1$Votes,
                        "Percentage"=Top1$Percentage)

output<-Electorate1

return(output)
}
```

After creating this function we focus only on the pages with one tables. Below is 
how we extract information from such pages and create a large data-frame.

```{r }
# list of pages with only one tables
pages<-c(10,18,31,48,58,61,64,70,82,87,90,96,99,110)

# creating a empty data-frame
datas1<-NULL

# creating the large data frame after extracting one table 
for (i in pages) 
        {
        # one table of each page is considered as a list element
        datas1[[i]]<-Extract_onetable(i)        
        }

# combining the multiple list data-frame as one data-frame
out2<-do.call("rbind",datas1)
```

![](/SLelection/2015/output2.JPG)

Now we have two data-frames which are named as out1 and out2 which 
needs to be combined based on rows. The combined data-frame is called
Election2015 which has all the information of Presidential Election 2015 
pdf file.

```{r Final data frame}
# final data frame which has information from the entire pdf
# which means combining the out1 and out2 data-frames
Election2015<-rbind(out1,out2)
```

![](/SLelection/2015/Election2015.JPG)

# Validating the Data

Even though I claim the data extraction is complete there needs to be validation. I find
it will be reassuring to have some form of validation. Therefore the best way is to tally the votes 
in individual districts and compare them with the final vote(which is on the last page of the pdf file).
I shall focus on the contestants Maithripala Sirisena, Mahinda Rajapaksa and data such as Valid Votes, Rejected 
votes and Total Polled. Below is the code to find those final votes which will be compared with the 

```{r Validating data frame}
# validating final votes of Maithripala Sirisena
ElecFinal2015<-subset(Election2015,Electorate=="Final District Votes" & ColNames=="Maithripala Sirisena" |
                              Electorate=="Final District Result" & ColNames=="Maithripala Sirisena")
ElecFinal2015[,sum(Votes),by="ColNames"]
sum(ElecFinal2015$Votes)

# validating final votes of Mahinda Rajapaksa
ElecFinal2015<-subset(Election2015,Electorate=="Final District Votes" & ColNames=="Mahinda Rajapaksa" |
                              Electorate=="Final District Result" & ColNames=="Mahinda Rajapaksa")
ElecFinal2015[,sum(Votes),by="ColNames"]
sum(ElecFinal2015$Votes)

# validating final votes of valid votes
ElecFinal2015<-subset(Election2015,Electorate=="Final District Votes" & ColNames=="Valid Votes" |
                              Electorate=="Final District Result" & ColNames=="Valid Votes")
ElecFinal2015[,sum(Votes),by="ColNames"]
sum(ElecFinal2015$Votes)

# validating final votes of rejected votes
ElecFinal2015<-subset(Election2015,Electorate=="Final District Votes" & ColNames=="Rejected Votes" |
                              Electorate=="Final District Result" & ColNames=="Rejected Votes")
ElecFinal2015[,sum(Votes),by="ColNames"]
sum(ElecFinal2015$Votes)

# validating final votes of polled votes
ElecFinal2015<-subset(Election2015,Electorate=="Final District Votes" & ColNames=="Total Polled" |
                              Electorate=="Final District Result" & ColNames=="Total Polled")
ElecFinal2015[,sum(Votes),by="ColNames"]
sum(ElecFinal2015$Votes)
```

If we compare the above results with below table clearly our extraction is much successful.

# Issues in the pdf file

Satisfying end to be honest, but there was one glitch if we consider the final district result table
only in one occasion the heading was inconsistent. This occurred for the Kalutara district, it should have
been "Final District Result" instead of "Final District Votes". Rather than that no issues at all. Similarly
if we identify some creative pattern step by step it is possible to extract all the presidential election data
and create a much more lucrative data retrieval website. Well we could even add the parliament and provincial election
results as well. 

For now One step at a time. 

**THANK YOU**
