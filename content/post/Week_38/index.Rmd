Over the weeks I have only done blog posts for TidyTuesday. Today for week 38, I am 
going to present my blog post in a presentation. This presentation does not include 
plots, but the code only. Therefore, I am putting the plots here. 

```{r my tweet,echo=FALSE}

## Species vs Sex vs BirthYear (code)

```{r Code Snippet 1}
Plot1<-ggplot(SeaCreature,aes(x=species,y=birthYear,color=sex))+
       geom_jitter()+
       coord_flip()+
       theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
       ggtitle("Species and Sex over their BirthYear")+
       ylab("Birth Year")+
       xlab("Species")+ 
       legend_bottom()  

#ggsave("Plot_1.png",width = 12,height = 12)
```

## Species vs Sex vs BirthYear (plot)

- Plot 1
- Alot of Bottle-nose type species from early years.
- More missing values for Birth Year.
- Second most goes to Killer Whale Orca.
- Third place is in with Beluga type Species.
- Here and there few of them without knowledge of Gender.

## Status vs Sex vs BirthYear (code)

```{r Code Snippet 2}
Plot2<-ggplot(SeaCreature,aes(x=str_wrap(status,8),
                              y=birthYear,color=sex))+
       geom_jitter()+
       coord_flip()+
       theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
       ggtitle("Status and Sex over their BirthYear")+
       ylab("Birth Year")+
       xlab("Status")+ 
       legend_bottom()  

#ggsave("Plot_2.png",width = 12,height = 12)
```

## Status vs Sex vs BirthYear (plot)

- Plot 2
- Dead Sea Creatures from the beginning of time itself. 
- Mostly dead, but from 1960 alot of them are alive.
- Birth Year unknown for most of the Dead and few of the Released.

## Species vs Sex vs Status (code)

```{r Code Snippet 3}
Plot3<-ggplot(SeaCreature,aes(x=str_wrap(status,8),
                              y=str_wrap(species,12),color=sex))+
       geom_jitter()+
       coord_flip()+
       theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
       ggtitle("Species and Sex over their status")+
       ylab("Species")+
       xlab("Status")+ 
       legend_bottom()  

#ggsave("Plot_3.png",width = 14,height = 12)
```

## Species vs Sex vs Status (plot)

- Plot 3
- One male Bottle-nose species escaped. 
- More Killer whale orca's and White-sided Pacific Species are 
  dead than alive 
- Around 15 Species have dead creatures and non alive.

## Birth Year and Sex of the Acquisitioned (code)

```{r Code Snippet 4}
Plot4<-ggplot(SeaCreature,aes(x=acquisition,
                              y=birthYear,color=sex))+
       geom_jitter()+
       theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
       ggtitle("Acquisitioned ones with their and BirthYear")+
       ylab("Birth Year")+
       xlab("Acquisition")+ 
       legend_bottom()  

#ggsave("Plot_4.png",width = 12,height = 12)
```

## Birth Year and Sex of the Acquisitioned (plot)

- Plot 4
- With early Birth Year to until 1990 the creatures were captured.
- From Birth Year 1971 to 2017 only the creatures are born.
- After 1965 around 30 creatures have been rescued.
- Close to 40 creatures with unknown status with Birth Year known.
- Most of the rescued ones are of Male gender.

## Species and their sex over current location (code)

```{r Code Snippet 5}
Plot5<-ggplot(SeaCreature,aes(x=str_wrap(species,12),
                              y=currently,color=sex))+
       geom_jitter()+
       theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
       ggtitle("Species and Sex over their Current Location")+
       ylab("Current Location")+
       xlab("Species")+ 
       legend_bottom()  

#ggsave("Plot_5.png",width = 14,height = 14)
```

## Species and their sex over current location (plot)

- Plot 5
- Close to 50 current locations.
- There are few locations with only one type of species.
- Bottle-nose creatures in most of these locations.
- Sea Life park in Hawaii has a diverse amount of Species.
- Sea world in San Diego is second when it comes to diversity.

## Acquisitioned ones and thier Sex with Status (code)

```{r Code Snippet 6}
Plot6<-ggplot(SeaCreature,aes(x=status,y=acquisition,color=sex))+
       geom_jitter()+
       ggtitle("Acquisitioned with Sex and Status")+
       xlab("Status")+
       ylab("Acquisition")+ 
       legend_bottom()  

#ggsave("Plot_6.png",width = 12,height = 12)
```


## Acquisitioned ones and thier Sex with Status (plot)

- Plot 6
- Most of the Captured creatures are Dead, but few of them Released.
- Most of the Rescued creatures are Dead, few alive and some Released.
- In Unknown acquisition-ed type alot of them are Dead.
- One rescued creature with unknown status.
- 6 creatures which were born have been released and 50% are male.

## Conclusion

- Ios slides are NICE. 
- Jitter plots useful for categorical data.
- Plots are too complex when using Location, Currently and Birth Year,
  but manageable. 
- Bottle-nose species is holding a special place in this data-set.
- Alot of unknown data points when it comes to Birth Year.
