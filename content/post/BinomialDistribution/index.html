<h1>Binomial Distribution</h1>
<p>The binomial distribution can be defined, using the binomial expansion</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ (q+p)^n = \sum_{x=0}^{n} {n \choose k} p^k q^{(n-k)} = \sum_{x=0}^{n} \frac{n!} {k! (n-k)!} p^k q^{(n-k)}\]</span></p>
<p>as the distribution of a randm variable X for which</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Pr[X=x] = {n \choose k} p^k q^{(n-k)}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(x=0,1,2,...,n.\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(q+p=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p,q&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a positive integer. When <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>, the distribution is known as the Bernoulli distribution. The mean and variance are <span class="math inline">\(\mu=np\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2 = npq\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> independent trials are made and in each there is probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that the outcome <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> will occur, then the number of trials in which <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> occurs can be represented by a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> having the binomial distribution with parameters <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>This situation occurs when a sample of ﬁxed size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is taken from an inﬁnite population where each element in the population has an <strong>“equal”</strong> and <strong>“independent”</strong> probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of possession of a speciﬁed attribute. The situation also arises when a sample of ﬁxed size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is taken from a ﬁnite population where each element in the population has an <strong>“equal”</strong> and <strong>“independent”</strong> probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of having a speciﬁed attribute and elements are sampled independently and sequentially with replacement.</p>
<p>The distribution was derived by James Bernoulli (in his treatise Ars Conjectandi, published in 1713), for the case <span class="math inline">\(p = r/(r+s)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> are positive integers.</p>
