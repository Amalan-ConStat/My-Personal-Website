# Binomial Distribution

The binomial distribution can be defined, using the binomial expansion 

$$ (q+p)^n = \sum_{x=0}^{n} {n \choose k} p^k q^{(n-k)} = \sum_{x=0}^{n} \frac{n!} {k! (n-k)!} p^k q^{(n-k)}$$

as the distribution of a randm variable X for which 

$$Pr[X=x] = {n \choose k} p^k q^{(n-k)}$$ 

$x=0,1,2,...,n.$ where $q+p=1$, $p,q>0$ and $n$ is a positive integer. When $n=1$, the distribution is known as the 
Bernoulli distribution. The mean and variance are $\mu=np$ and  $\mu_2 = npq$.

If $n$ independent trials are made and in each there is probability $p$ that the outcome $E$ will occur, 
then the number of trials in which $E$ occurs can be represented by a random variable $X$ having the binomial distribution 
with parameters $n$, $p$. 

This situation occurs when a sample of ﬁxed size $n$ is taken from an inﬁnite population 
where each element in the population has an **"equal"** and **"independent"** probability $p$ of possession of a speciﬁed 
attribute. The situation also arises when a sample of ﬁxed size $n$ is taken from a ﬁnite population where each 
element in the population has an **"equal"** and **"independent"** probability $p$ of having a speciﬁed attribute 
and elements are sampled independently and sequentially with replacement. 

The distribution was derived by James Bernoulli (in his treatise Ars Conjectandi, published in 1713), 
for the case $p = r/(r+s)$, where $r$ and $s$ are positive integers.
