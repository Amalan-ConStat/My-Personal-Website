<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>5 data-sets are given here, but I will be only discussing 3. They are Fluid Milk Sales, State Milk production and Clean Cheese. Clean Cheese has only few rows (48) and few columns (17). This is not the case in Fluid Milk Sales and State Milk production.</p>

<h1>Fluid Milk Sales</h1>
<p>Fluid Milk Sales has information for 9 different types of milk and how their Consumption in Pounds has changed over time from 1970 to 2017. We can see how Whole and Reduced Fat(2%) type milk are changing over the years with significant amount. Further, We can see how other types are changing from the initial order in 1970 of lower(Eggnog) amount to higher(Whole) amount in pounds over the years.</p>

<h1>State Milk Production</h1>
<p>In the 48 years we are separating them by 24 years each for a plot. Using <a href="">usmap</a> package I am going to plot it into their respective states in perspective of Milk Produced lbs in 10^6.</p>

<h2>US States and Milk Production Over the Years</h2>
<p>In the first half of 1970 to 1993 we can see how a few states are having steady increase over the years.</p>

<p>This is similar to the next half years which is from 1994 to 2017 as well. Similar increase occurs for the above same states as I see in the below plot. Well it is not very accurately described in the two plots for us to see.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># plot in us map the milk produced by state for years 1994 to 2017

<p>To understand the above same change over the years clearly I have created a bar plot how the increase occurs. This plot also indicates how much change has occurred over the 48 years for each state who produces milk. Clearly the states California and Wisconsin have higher increase over the years, which is very strong. There are some states which have not produced more amount each year their previous years.</p>
<p>The states Wyoming, Rhode island, Hawaii, Delaware and Alaska have very low amount of milk production over the years.</p>

<h2>Summing States of Same Regions Over the Years</h2>
<p>There are 50 states but only 10 regions and not all regions have equal amount of states. Therefore I am going to sum up the milk production for all regions over the years and try to understand if there is any pattern.</p>
<p>In order to do this I have used the <a href="">dplyr</a> package and created a function which would sum up the production for each region of each year. Similarly, this function has the ability to get the average production for each region of each year as well.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># manipulating the data by sum and mean
by_region_sum&lt;-function(i,ch_sum)
{
  if(ch_sum==TRUE)
  {

                  group_by(region) %&gt;%
                  summarise_each(funs(sum))
  
  output&lt;-data.frame(year=rep(i,10), region=temp$region, milk_produced=temp$milk_produced)

<h2>Cheese with known Type Names</h2>
<p>Next group of cheese types include Cheddar, Mozzarella, Brick, Processed Cheese and Foods &amp; spreads for the colors respectively red, yellow, blue, green and white. Clearly Cheddar and mozzarella type cheese are are mostly consumed by 2017 above 10 lbs per person, but this is not the case in 1970 where consumption is less than 6 lbs per person.</p>
<p>Well Processed Cheese and Foods &amp; Spreads have changed very small over the years. The consumption is always less than 6 lbs per person. This is not the case for Brick type cheese where the consumption is close to zero over the years from 1970 until 2017.</p>
