<p>Even though I can go further and do an investigative plotting from the rest data it is not done here. I was more focused on the scientific notation values in the plotting and scales, which were bothering me a lot.</p>
<p>3 Data sets are given here, they are</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Global Climate Change Research Program Spending. - climate</li>
<li>Energy Departments Data. - energy</li>
<li>Total Federal R &amp; D Spending by Department. - federal</li>
</ol>
<p>Oddly though climate data-set did not have year values, I checked the downloaded csv file and the GitHub upload as well. Well, That did not stop me from doing some tidy plotting.</p>
<p>You can obtain the data from <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-02-12">here.</a> It should be noted that I am not going to rename the abbreviation of departments with their full names, so below is a screen shot which would come in handy.</p>

<h1>Climate Change Research</h1>
<p>As I mentioned earlier for the climate data there are no values in the year column, but according to summary I was able to deduce that we have 18 years of information. When we do plot it is going to be the summation for each department in a bar.</p>
<p>Clearly NASA has the most amount ( above than 2.5 x 10^10) of spending because rockets are expensive, second place goes to NSF (5 x 10^9) and third place to NOAA. Lowest amount of spending is to the department of interior (8.47 x 10^8).</p>

  geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;,show.legend = FALSE)+
  ggtitle(&quot;Total GCC Spending for 18 Years&quot;)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::scientific,breaks = seq(0,2.75e+10,0.25e+10))+
  xlab(&quot;Sub Agency / Department&quot;)+ylab(&quot;GCC Spending (in USD)&quot;)</code></pre>

<h1>Energy</h1>
<p>Since 1997 to 2018 how Energy Department funding has changed with sub agency/ department. Office of Science R &amp; D and Atomic Energy Defense are competitive over the years and for a short period of time the latter has less funding than the former, this was between 2006 to 2010.</p>
<p>Other agencies oscillates over the years while reaching new highs and lows.</p>

<h1>Federal</h1>
<p>Data of Federal funding has four different types to be compared and they are mentioned below in the description image which would make explanation more easier.</p>

<p>Except rd_budget other have a very clear increasing amount between 1976 to 2018. Further, all four plots have different scales and the limits are widely different for each plot.</p>
