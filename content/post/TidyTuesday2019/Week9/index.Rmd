# Network Graph for the French City Trains

Simply drawing a network graph to understand which french cities are mainly urban with 
capacity to trains arriving and departuring. Cities such as Paris Lyon, Paris Montparnasse,
Paris Nord and Paris Est could be cities of concern with much for traffic with related to trains.

```{r network graph, fig.width= 14,fig.height=14}
ggplot(small_trains,aes(from_id=departure_station,to_id=arrival_station))+
          geom_net(directed = TRUE,labelon = TRUE,size=0.5,labelcolour = "black",
                   repel = FALSE,ecolour = "grey70", arrowsize = 0.75,
                   linewidth = 0.5,layout.alg = "fruchtermanreingold")+
          theme_net()+
          ggtitle("Network Graph Showing from City to City of French Trains")

```

# Paris Montparnasse

Let me focus on Montparnasse which has lot of trains coming towards and departuring outwards
according to the network map. Not all are cities of France according to my observations, where
I can see Madrid, Zurich and Barcelona. 

## Chosen City with Total Number of Trips

Total number of trips from Paris Montparnasse station to other cities is noted here.
Four years of data with more accuracy by months is considered in this plot.
There is clear variation in this data for cities. 

Close to 800 trips have been recorded towards the Bordeaux St Jean city but not clearly the same
pattern for all years or months as well. Further, St Malo city has the lowest amount of trips
compared to other cities in all fours but follows a centered pattern around the 100 mark.

```{r Paris Montparnasse total num of trips}
p<-ggplot(subset(small_trains,departure_station=="PARIS MONTPARNASSE"),
       aes(x=str_wrap(arrival_station,20),y=total_num_trips,color=month))+
       geom_jitter()+coord_flip()+ labs(color="Month")+
       transition_time(year)+ease_aes("linear")+
       scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,800,100),labels=seq(0,800,100))+
       xlab("Arrival Station")+ylab("Total Number of Trips")+
       ggtitle("Paris Montparnasse and its arrival Stations" ,subtitle ="Year :{frame_time}")

animate(p,nframes=4,fps=1)
```

## Chosen City with Average Journey Time

Except year 2017 all cities has similar and centered data points. In this exceptional
year of 2017 we can see a difference between the first six months and rest. Where most 
of the Average journey times have been reduced, it is clear according to year 2018 points.

City of Toulouse Matabiau has the highest Average Journey Time, while lowest time goes to the city 
of Le Mans. So what happened after mid of year 2017.

Maximum Average Journey time before mid of year 2017 is close to 325 but after this period 
it is centered around 275. The Minimum Average Journey time before mid of year
2017 and after also it is close to 50. 

```{r Paris Montparnasse Journey time average}
p<-ggplot(subset(small_trains,departure_station=="PARIS MONTPARNASSE"),
       aes(x=str_wrap(arrival_station,20),y=journey_time_avg,color=month))+
       geom_jitter()+coord_flip()+ labs(color="Month")+
       transition_time(year)+ease_aes("linear")+
       scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,350,25),labels=seq(0,350,25))+
       xlab("Arrival Station")+ylab("Average Journey Time")+
       ggtitle("Paris Montparnasse and its arrival Station" ,subtitle ="Year :{frame_time}")

animate(p,nframes=4,fps=1)
```

## Chosen City with Average Delay with All Departing

There is no clear pattern in perspective of months or years because data points are spread
all over the place. Yet there is an odd occuring of negative values for average delay with all
departing for some cities after mid of year 2017. 

Well none of these negative values does not exceed -2.5, where the maximum average dealy in 
all departing is close to 5.5. I belive unit measured is in minutes.

```{r Paris Montparnasse avg delay all departing}
p<-ggplot(subset(small_trains,departure_station=="PARIS MONTPARNASSE"),
       aes(x=str_wrap(arrival_station,20),y= avg_delay_all_departing,color=month))+
       geom_jitter()+coord_flip()+ labs(color="Month")+
       scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-2.5,5.5,0.5),labels=seq(-2.5,5.5,0.5))+
       transition_time(year)+ease_aes("linear")+
       geom_hline(yintercept = 0,color="red")+
       xlab("Arrival Station")+ylab("Average Delay All Departing")+
       ggtitle("Paris Montparnasse and its arrival Station" ,subtitle ="Year :{frame_time}")

animate(p,nframes=4,fps=1)
```

## Chosen City with Average Delay with All Arriving

Highest delay could occur close to 18 minutes for average delay in Arriving and
the lowest is close to -3. only in 2018 we see such negative values. 
These negative values occurs for the city of St Malo. Also there is no clear
pattern in any city with relative to year or months.

```{r Paris Montparnasse avg delay all arriving}
p<-ggplot(subset(small_trains,departure_station=="PARIS MONTPARNASSE"),
       aes(x=str_wrap(arrival_station,20),y=avg_delay_all_arriving,color=month))+
       geom_jitter()+coord_flip()+ labs(color="Month")+
       transition_time(year)+ease_aes("linear")+
       geom_hline(yintercept = 0,color="red")+
       scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-3,18),labels=seq(-3,18))+
       xlab("Arrival Station")+ylab("Average Delay All Arriving")+
       ggtitle("Paris Montparnasse and its arrival Station" ,subtitle ="Year :{frame_time}")

animate(p,nframes=4,fps=1)
```

## Chosen City with Number of Late Departures

Number of Late departures over the years increases for all cities. It is more 
clear for Bordeaux St Jean where the counts go beyond 150 and close to 200 in the 
year of 2018, but in 2015 the highest point is close to 75 for the same city. 

St Malo has the lowest number of late departures where it fails to reach the count 
of 30 in all four years.

```{r Paris Montparnasse num late at departure}
p<-ggplot(subset(small_trains,departure_station=="PARIS MONTPARNASSE"),
       aes(x=str_wrap(arrival_station,20),y=num_late_at_departure,
           color=month))+
       geom_jitter()+coord_flip()+ labs(color="Month")+
       scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,200,25),labels=seq(0,200,25))+
       transition_time(year)+ease_aes("linear")+
       xlab("Arrival Station")+ylab("Number of Lates at Departure")+
       ggtitle("Paris Montparnasse and its arrival Station" ,subtitle ="Year :{frame_time}")

           color=month))+
       geom_jitter()+coord_flip()+ labs(color="Month")+
