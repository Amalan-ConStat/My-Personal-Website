# Introduction

[mle]() and [mle2]() 
are my favorite functions, because they provide extensive amount of outputs
for the optimization process. Even though there is no difference in analytial methods 
used in both of these functions. Further, these analytical methods are the same ones used
by optim function. To be honest mle and mle2 functions are wrapper functions of optim. It means
both mle and mle2 are using the optim function inside but with some additional inputs, which
would generate extended outputs.

Even if I do Benchmark the analytical methods for the mle function it would be very similar to
optim function tables but with additional time taken, because of the extra outputs. This would 
similarly occur when we benchmark analytical methods from the mle2 function as well. 

Therefore, I figure why do we need to benchmark them at all. So this blog post is to 
simply reiterate the initial things which I said in my earlier post on the blog post
[Benchmarking optimization functions in R]().

## mle

mle function is from the [stats4]() 
package. If we intend to use this function for
the estimation of shape parameters a and b of the Beta-Binomial distribution when
Binomial Outcome Data, then we need to use the EstMLEBetaBin function from the fitODBOD
package. This is not enough because for limitations in the mle we need to make changes 
in our EstMLEBetaBin function as mentioned below. 

```{r using mle,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,results='hide'}
library(stats4)
library(fitODBOD)

#new function to facilitate mle criteria 

formle<-function(a,b)
{
  EstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days,freq = Alcohol_data$week1,a,b)
}

# optimizing values for a,b using default analytial method
mle_answer<-mle(minuslogl = formle,start = list(a=0.1,b=0.2))
```

We are going to use the Alcohol Consumption data of week 1. In the above code
chunk we are using the mle function for our task of finding the optimum shape parameter
values for a and b while using the give Binomial Outcome data.

## mle2

[bbmle]() 
package holds the mle2 function. It is simply an updated version for mle function. 

```{r using mle2 function}

```
