# Estimating the shape parameters of Beta-Binomial Distribution

# Introduction

Beginning of this month I wrote a 
[small section](https://amalan-con-stat.netlify.com/post/fitodbod_1/benchmarking-maximum-liklihood-functions-from-r/#maxlik-function) 
regarding maxLik function by comparing it to other optimization functions. Here, we will further study the analytical methods
which can be used in this function and compare them to find suitability. maxLik function is from the package 
[maxLik](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maxLik/index.html). Further, 
[Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/maxLik/versions/1.3-4/topics/maxLik)
clearly indicates all things related to the function in detail. 

Focusing on the seven analytical methods is my intention from this blog post. So, we have the Beta-Binomial distribution and Binomial 
Outcome data, and need to estimate proper shape parameters which would Maximize the Log Likelihood value of the Beta-Binomial 
distribution for the above Binomial Outcome data. In this case Alcohol Consumption data from the 
[fitODBOD](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fitODBOD) package will be used.

Further we will focus on the process time to optimization, estimated shape parameters, maximized Log Likelihood value, 
expected frequencies, p-value and Over-dispersion with tables.

Below are the seven analytical methods in concern

1. NR
2. BFGS
3. BFGSR
4. BHHH
5. SANN
6. CG
7. NM

Alcohol Consumption data has two sets of frequency values but only values from week 1 will be used. Below is the the Alcohol 
Consumption data, where number of observations is 399 and the Binomial Random variable is a vector of values from zero to seven.

```{r Data}
library(fitODBOD)
kable(Alcohol_data,"html",align=c('c','c','c')) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped"),font_size = 14,full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0,color = "blue") %>%
  column_spec(1,color = "red")
```

## Brief of maxLik Function

Small [section](https://amalan-con-stat.netlify.com/post/fitodbod_1/benchmarking-maximum-liklihood-functions-from-r/#maxlik-function)
about the maxLik function will be very useful to understand this blog post. 

Reference : Henningsen, A. and Toomet, O. (2011): maxLik: A package for maximum likelihood estimation in R Computational Statistics 26, 
443--458 Marquardt, D.W., (1963) An Algorithm for Least-Squares Estimation of Nonlinear Parameters, 
Journal of the Society for Industrial & Applied Mathematics 11, 2, 431--441

So for the initial parameters of a=0.1 and b=0.2 we will be finding estimated parameters from different analytical methods which 
would maximize the Log Likelihood value of the Beta-Binomial distribution.

Here also we are transforming the given EstMLEBetaBin function to satisfy the maxLik function conditions.

```{r maxLik function from stats package}
# new function to facilitate maxLik criteria
# only one input but has two elements
formaxLik<-function(a)
  {
  -EstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days, freq=Alcohol_data$week1,a=a[1],b=a[2])
  }
```

So the formaxLik function can be used as above and parameters are estimated for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (or a, b) for the Alcohol 
Consumption data week 1. Further the maxLik function can be scrutinized as below.

* package : maxLik 
* No of Inputs: 6
* Minimum required Inputs : 2
* Class of output : list or class of maxim or class of maxLik
* No of outputs: 11
* No of Analytical Methods : 7
* Default Method : Automatically chosen

## NR method

NR is an abbreviation for Unconstrained and equality-constrained maximization based on the quadratic approximation (Newton) method.
The idea of the Newton method is to approximate the function at a given location by a multidimensional quadratic function, and use 
the estimated maximum as the start value for the next iteration.

```{r maxLik function NR method, results='hide'}
library(maxLik)

# optimizing values for a,b using NR analytical method
NR_answer<-maxLik(logLik =formaxLik, start = c(0.1,0.2),method = "NR")

# obtaining class of output
class(NR_answer)

# length of output
length(NR_answer)

# the outputs
NR_answer$estimate # estimated values for a, b
NR_answer$maximum # minimized function value 
NR_answer$iterations  # no of iterations to succeed
NR_answer$gradient # last gradient value which was calculated
NR_answer$message # additional information
NR_answer$hessian # hessian matrix
NR_answer$code # indicates successful completion
NR_answer$fixed # logical vector indicating which parameters are constants
NR_answer$type # type of maximization

# fitting the Beta-Binomial distribution with estimated shape parameter values
fitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,
           NR_answer$estimate[1],NR_answer$estimate[2])
```

## BFGS method

BFGS is a Quasi-Newton method (also known as a variable metric algorithm), specifically that published simultaneously in 1970 by Broyden, 
Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno. This uses function values and gradients to build up a picture of the surface to be optimized.

Reference : Broyden, C.G., 1967. Quasi-Newton methods and their application to function minimization. Mathematics of Computation, 
21(99), pp.368-381.

```{r maxLik function BFGS method, results='hide'}
# optimizing values for a,b using BFGS analytical method
BFGS_answer<-maxLik(logLik =formaxLik, start = c(0.1,0.2),method = "BFGS")

# obtaining class of output

# length of output

# the outputs

fitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,
           BFGS_answer$estimate[1],BFGS_answer$estimate[2])
```


## BFGSR method

Combination of two methods which are Newton-Raphson, BFGS (Broyden 1970, Fletcher 1970, Goldfarb 1970, Shanno 1970).

Reference : Broyden, C.G., 1967. Quasi-Newton methods and their application to function minimization. Mathematics of Computation, 21(99), 
pp.368-381.

```{r maxLik function BFGSR method, results='hide'}
# optimizing values for a,b using BFGSR analytical method
BFGSR_answer<-maxLik(logLik =formaxLik, start = c(0.1,0.2),method = "BFGSR")

# obtaining class of output

# length of output

# the outputs

fitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,
           BFGSR_answer$estimate[1],BFGSR_answer$estimate[2])
```

## BHHH method

BHHH method (Berndt, Hall, Hall, Hausman 1974). The BHHH (information equality) approximation is only valid for log-likelihood functions. 
It requires the score (gradient) values by individual observations and hence those must be returned by individual observations by grad or fn. 
With the complexity of BHHH method I choose not to discuss it here, but a reference is mentioned to anyone who has interest in
this analytical method.

Reference : Berndt, E., Hall, B., Hall, R. and Hausman, J. (1974): Estimation and Inference in Nonlinear Structural Models, 
Annals of Social Measurement 3, 653--665.

## SANN method

Method "SANN" is by default a variant of simulated annealing given in Belisle (1992). Simulated-annealing belongs to 
the class of stochastic global optimization methods. It uses only function values but is relatively slow. It will also 
work for non-differential functions. This implementation uses the Metropolis function for the acceptance probability. 
By default the next candidate point is generated from a Gaussian Markov kernel with scale proportional to the actual
temperature. If a function to generate a new candidate point is given, method "SANN" can also be used to solve
combinatorial optimization problems. Temperatures are decreased according to the logarithmic cooling schedule as given 
in Belisle (1992, p.890); specifically, the temperature is set to $temp / log(((t-1) %/% tmax)*tmax + exp(1))$, where $t$ 
is the current iteration step and temp and tmax are specifiable via control, see below. Note that the "SANN" method 
depends critically on the settings of the control parameters. It is not a general-purpose method but can be very useful 
in getting to a good value on a very rough surface.

Probability, 29(4), pp.885-895.

# optimizing values for a,b using SANN analytical method

fitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,
           SANN_answer$estimate[1],SANN_answer$estimate[2])
```

## CG method

According to the documentation Method CG is a conjugate gradients method based on that by Fletcher and Reeves (1964) 
(but with the option of Polak-Ribiere or Beale-Sorenson updates). Conjugate gradient methods will generally be more fragile 
than the BFGS method, but as they do not store a matrix they may be successful in much larger optimization problems.

Reference : Fletcher, R. and Reeves, C.M., 1964. Function minimization by conjugate gradients. The computer journal, 7(2), pp.149-154.

```{r maxLik function CG method, results='hide'}
# optimizing values for a,b using CG analytical method
CG_answer<-maxLik(logLik =formaxLik, start = c(0.1,0.2),method = "CG")

# obtaining class of output

# the outputs

fitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,
           CG_answer$estimate[1],CG_answer$estimate[2])
```

## NM method

NM is the abbreviation to Nelder and Mead method. According to the documentation it uses only function values and 
is robust but relatively slow. It will work reasonably well for non-differential functions.

Reference : Nelder, J.A. and Mead, R., 1965. A simplex method for function minimization. The computer journal, 7(4), pp.308-313.

```{r maxLik function NM method, results='hide'}
# optimizing values for a,b using NM analytical method
NM_answer<-maxLik(logLik =formaxLik, start = c(0.1,0.2),method = "NM")

# obtaining class of output
class(NM_answer)

# length of output
length(NM_answer)

# the outputs
NM_answer$estimate # estimated values for a, b
NM_answer$maximum # minimized function value

# Sumary of Time evalutation for different Analytical methods of maxLik function

Below table will compare the system process time for different analytical methods. 
In order to do this time comparison it is possible to use the 
[benchmark](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rbenchmark/versions/1.0.0/topics/benchmark) 
function of [rbenchmark](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rbenchmark) package. 
Below mentioned code chunk provides the output in a table form which includes the analytical 
methods and their respective time values. The estimation process of the parameters where each
method has been replicated 1000 times to receive a more accurate table for time values.

Table is in the ascending order for elapsed time column. It is evidently clear that
<> analytical method has taken the most time. While <> method has taken the least time.
This time is calculated for 1000 replications of the function being repeated under
same conditions. These times does not only reflect based on analytical method, rather
on the Negative Log Likelihood function that needs to be minimized, the data provided,
the number of estimated that needs to be estimated, the complexity of the function and 
finally the computer's processing power.

```{r time benchmark}
library(rbenchmark)

Results1<-benchmark(
          "NR"={ maxLik(logLik =formaxLik, start = c(0.1,0.2), method = "NR")},

Estimated shape parameter a,b received by the analytical methods NR, BFGS, BFGSR, SANN,
CG and NM. These estimated parameters will be now used in the fitBetaBin function to find
the expected frequencies, p-values and over-dispersion. The above measurements can be used
compared for each analytical methods for any significance difference.
