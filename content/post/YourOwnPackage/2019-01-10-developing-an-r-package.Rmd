# Introduction

R package development is no longer as it was before 2010 because now most of the work can be done by
just a simple mouse-click or with the use of a function. My intention of writing this blog post is not to 
give a thorough demonstration of how to develop your own R package. But it will briefly explain the 
process with the most important steps, and will include valueable blog posts and websites which helped me
to develop my own R package [fitODBOD.](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fitODBOD)

# Credit
  
  I would definitely recommend read all of these books and start your package developement. Or
  at least make step by step progress in your work while reading them. If you have a basic knowledge 
  regarding R, Rstudio, CRAN and writing programs, they are more than enough for you to start.
  
* [R packages by Hadley Wickam](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)

  This website contains everything that is in the book. The basic things related to an R
  package development process are structed properly here. It is very useful to read this 
  book/website. The package structure, the type of files necessary, how should the writing be
  in these files and further, what kind of ways can we use to achieve the final outputs. 
  The book is mainly focused on producing an R package which can be updated with the highest 
  standards using reproducing ability. Such as CRAN standards and GitHub releases. 
  
* [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html)

  Everything related to package development is included here with clear instructions.
  This document is provided by the CRAN project to make package development more friendlier.
  It includes the official standards for files and naming conventions related to R package 
  development.
