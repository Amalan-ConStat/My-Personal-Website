# Introduction

R package development is no longer as it was before 2010 because now most of the work can be done by
just a simple mouse-click or with the use of a function. My intention of writing this blog post is not to 
give a thorough demonstration of how to develop your own R package. But it will briefly explain the 
process with the most important steps, and will include valueable blog posts and websites which helped me
to develop my own R package [fitODBOD.](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fitODBOD)
