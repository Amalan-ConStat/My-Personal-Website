<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>R package development is no longer as it was before 2010 because now most of the work can be done by just a simple mouse-click or with the use of a function. My intention of writing this blog post is not to give a thorough demonstration of how to develop your own R package. But it will briefly explain the process with the most important steps, and will include valuable blog posts and websites which helped me to develop my own R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=fitODBOD">fitODBOD.</a></p>
</div>
<div id="credit-to-people-of-r-community" class="section level1">
<h1>Credit to People of R Community</h1>
<p>I would definitely recommend to read all of these books and start your package development. Or at least make step by step progress in your work while reading them. If you have a basic knowledge regarding R, R studio, CRAN and writing programs, they are more than enough for you to start.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/">R packages by Hadley Wickam</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This website contains everything that is in the book. The basic things related to an R package development process are structured properly here. It is very useful to read this book/website. The package structure, the type of files necessary, how should the writing be in these files and further, what kind of ways can we use to achieve the final outputs. The book is mainly focused on producing an R package which can be updated with the highest standards using reproducing ability. Such as CRAN standards and GitHub releases.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html">Writing R Extensions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Everything related to package development is included here with clear instructions. This document is provided by the CRAN project to make package development more friendlier. It includes the official standards for files and naming conventions related to R package development.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Leisch-CreatingPackages.pdf">Creating R packages: A Tutorial by Friedrich Leish</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A brief article explaining about writing functions, classes and methods for R package development. This is very abstract and useful in package development specially as it is focusing on object oriented programming and S formulas.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf">R for Beginners by Emmanuel Paradis</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A book explaining R and its ability in detail, for example regarding functions, data, abilities and limitations of R. There is also a section for R packages, which has valuable information. Writing functions is very crucial in R package development therefore going through this document is worth. Several packages also include data-sets in them. While you develop functions similarly we can develop data-sets as well. There are sections which includes information regarding data-sets as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://diytranscriptomics.com/Reading/files/The%20Art%20of%20R%20Programming.pdf">The Art of R Programming by Norman Matloff</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Another book that will be useful in understanding how R functions and data-sets can be used in R package development.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf">The R Inferno by Patrick Burns</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Useful book related to object oriented programming, functions and data objects related to R. Very thorough and scrutinized information with valuable explanation which makes things more clearer.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/">Cheat Sheets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Easy implementation of packages mentioned in these cheatsheets. Very essential for someone who is interested in doing R related stuff efficient and eloquent.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/">R Markdown: The Definitive Guide by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, Garrett Grolemund</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Notes related to RMarkdown, very useful for vignette building.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://happygitwithr.com/">Happy Git and GitHub for the useR by Jenny Bryan, the STAT 545 TAs, Jim Hester</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Using GitHub for package development is very useful, specially when it comes to sharing and version control. This book explains it all with simplicity.</p>

<div id="coding-standards-coding-to-understand" class="section level2">
<h2>1) Coding Standards (Coding to Understand)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Focus on naming conventions.</li>
<li>Focus on input parameters and outputs.</li>
<li>Focus on indentation.</li>
<li>Comment regularly to make sense of the functions.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div id="package-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>2) Package Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Very Important.</li>
<li>Initially few files be originated in the designated project folder.</li>

</div>
<div id="description-file" class="section level2">
<h2>3) DESCRIPTION file</h2>
<ul>
<li>File explaining basic things related to your package.</li>
<li>Example - package name, other packages needed, authors name, …</li>
<li>Can edit manually or use specific R package.</li>

<h2>5) /R directory</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most important directory.</li>
<li>The place where all your R code is written by you.</li>
<li>Best to have separate R script files for each function.</li>
<li>Need to have a R script file for Data as well.</li>
<li>R scripts can be modified further in order to create RDocumentation files(Rd files).</li>
<li>These RDocumentation files will explain about the function.</li>
<li>Processed R script files will automatically generate Rd files in the man directory.</li>

<li>Unit tests to check if functions are working properly.</li>
<li>Testing if the data sets are in proper form.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/YourOwnPackage/directory/figure4.PNG" /> tests directory and files in side that directory.</p>

<div id="building-the-package" class="section level1">
<h1>Building the Package</h1>
<p>All the files should be in their respective directories and names should not changed for files or folders manually if they are created automatically. After checking all of this we can proceed to building the package. This process has 9 steps and below is a diagram to show how it works.</p>
<div id="htmlwidget-2" style="width:1000px;height:300px;" class="DiagrammeR html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-2">{"x":{"diagram":"graph LR;\n           A(Document <br> Generation)-->C(Clean and <br> Rebuild);\n           C-->D(Spellcheck <br> Rd files);\n           D-->B((Check for <br> issues));\n           B-->Z((Make Necessary <br> Changes)); Z-->A;\n           D-->E(Test <br> the Package); E-->B;\n           E-->F(Check <br> for Errors); F-->B;\n           F-->G(Build <br> Source Package);\n           G-->H(Build <br> Binary Package);\n           H-->I(Generate <br> Manual pdf);\n           I-->J(Check Errors <br> on Source Package); J-->B"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>This process is explained through a small presentation <a href="/YourOwnPackage/BuildYourOwnPackage.html">here</a>. This presentation also can be used to when you need to update your package version.</p>
</div>
<div id="distributing-the-package" class="section level1">
<h1>Distributing the Package</h1>
<p>There are several ways of distributing your package. They are mainly</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>tar.qz version.</li>
<li>zip version.</li>
<li>GitHub Repository.</li>
<li>The project folder which includes the package.</li>
<li>Submit to CRAN or Bioconductor.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have written two posts related to R packages as well. One is <a href="https://amalan-con-stat.netlify.com/post/findrpackage/how-to-find-your-r-package/">How to find your R package</a> and Second is <a href="https://amalan-con-stat.netlify.com/post/newpackage/build-a-new-package-with-existing-r-packages/">Using R packages to develop your own package</a>. These two posts will be very useful.</p>
