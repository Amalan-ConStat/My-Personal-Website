# Introduction 

Rshiny is very popular in the rstats community. The glamourous interface and functionality
has helped for this level of popularity. In perspective of using an Rshiny App anyone can
use it with minimal amount of knowledge. Which is very useful in bringing statistical
analysis to consumers or general public without any trouble. 

I initially wanted to develop an Rshiny App for my fitODBOD package, but I thought it would be best
to test the waters. That is what I have done here. Using the Olympic data 
from kaggle I have found a very convenient way to understand specific results
for a choosen country from the Rshiny App.

At the beginning I wanted to compare between diferent countries or sports or seasons
and come to a conclusion. Well, what kind of a conclusion would make sense bothered me,
therefore I turned towards an Rshiny Approach. 

This data-set includes information from 1896 to 2016. Analyzing the data-set would take 
tedious amount of time and in my opinion unnecessary amount of complications will arise 
when it comes to concluding. Information from the data-set includes about Medals, 
participants name, country, sports, events, season and year.

## Material Useful for Rsiny Development

Easiest way to build your own shiny app is to refer the official website. It provides 
extensive amount of information regarding Rshiny development. Already developed Rshiny 
Apps and Templates are also available, which would come in handy. Further, when you do
start an Rshiny App through Rstudio you will initially receive a sample App with its code.
A few tweaks and changes would lead to necessary changes that you need.

## How To Use The Olympic Rshiny App ?

Instructions are also listed in the Rshiny App panel.

### Step 1 

First Choose a country that you want to study and find the three letter NOC CODE
from the "NOC CODE" tab. 

### Step 2 

Choose the "GRAPH" tab to understand how medals were won for a chosen country 
over the years with respective to Gender.

### Step 3

through this data and find specific attendee's Name, Sex, Age, Year, Season, City, 
Sport, Event and Medal.

### Step 4

Using "DESCRIBE" tab you can simply study the descriptive statistics for the data 
of the chosen country.

### Step 5 

"G/Years" tab is there to explain the Gender representation over the years of the chosen
country through a bar plot.

### Step 6

"S/Years" tab shows a bar plot which has the representation of the Gender of the Sports event 
participants of the chosen country.

with respective to Gender for the chosen country.

*PLEASE NOTE* - You should remember that as a user of this Rshiny Application 
not all countries have won atleast one medal at the Olympics. At these occurences 
"MEDAL GRAPH" tab does not show any graph but only an error. This can be confirmed
by the "DESCRIBE" tab which will produce the summary for that chosen country.
