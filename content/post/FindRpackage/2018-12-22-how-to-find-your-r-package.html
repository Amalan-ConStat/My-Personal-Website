<p>How to find your R package is simply a blog post helping people to provide a list of websites where they can find R packages. These websites were useful for me while developing my own R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=fitODBOD">fitODBOD</a>. So that I would be sure that fitODBOD is a unique package and what its functions should be able to do.</p>
<p>This is a list with 16 items</p>
