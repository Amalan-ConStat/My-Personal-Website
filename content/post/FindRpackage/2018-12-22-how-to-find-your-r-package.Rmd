How to find your R package is simply a blog post helping people to provide 
a list of websites. This websites were useful for me while developing 
my own package [fitODBOD](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fitODBOD)to be sure 
that it is a unique package and to choose what my functions should be able to do. 

This is a list with 14 items 

# 1. Google

When you have no idea to find a package first thing is to "Google".

# 2. CRAN

Official website to find standard packages. The packages downloaded here will 
have documentation manuals, vignettes and sometimes journal articles which would 
simplify work for people who use thme.

# 3. Bio - Conductor

This is another location to publish your R package, but only related to the 
field of biology.

# 4. GitHub pages

If CRAN or Bio - Conductor is with high standards or too much work for your 
package we can still publish it. The ideal place is GitHub.
