How to find your R package is simply a blog post helping people to provide 
a list of websites where they can find R packages. These websites were useful for me while developing 
my own R package [fitODBOD](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fitODBOD). So that I would be sure 
that fitODBOD is a unique package and what its functions should be able to do. 

This is a list with 16 items 

# 1. Google

When you have no idea to find a package first thing is to "Google".

# 2. CRAN

Official website to find standard packages. The packages downloaded here will 
have documentation manuals, vignettes and sometimes journal articles which would 
simplify work for people who use them.

# 3. Bio - Conductor

Another standard location to publish your R package, but only related to the 
field of Biology.

# 4. GitHub pages

If CRAN or Bio - Conductor is with high standards or too much work for your 
package you can still publish it and the ideal place for this is GitHub.

# 5. Rdocumentation

A place to find interactive documentation for the packages in 
CRAN, Bio - Conductor and GitHub. They simply include everything in the manual of a
package but in html format.

on Authors, package name, reviews and tags.

Similar to crantastic this website also provides information to CRAN packages, but it is better 
because package related statistics is also shown here.
