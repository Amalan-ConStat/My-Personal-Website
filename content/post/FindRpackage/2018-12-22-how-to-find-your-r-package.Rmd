How to find your R package is simply a blog post helping people to provide 
a list of websites. This websites were useful for me while developing 
my own package [fitODBOD](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fitODBOD)to be sure 
that it is a unique package and to choose what my functions should be able to do. 

This is a list with 16 items 

# 1. Google

When you have no idea to find a package first thing is to "Google".

# 2. CRAN

Official website to find standard packages. The packages downloaded here will 
have documentation manuals, vignettes and sometimes journal articles which would 
simplify work for people who use them.

package we can still publish it. The ideal place is GitHub.
