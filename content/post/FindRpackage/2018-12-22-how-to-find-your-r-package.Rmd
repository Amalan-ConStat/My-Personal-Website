How to find your R package is simply a blog post helping people to provide 
a list of websites. This websites were useful for me while developing 
my own package [fitODBOD](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fitODBOD)to be sure 
that it is a unique package and to choose what my functions should be able to do. 

This is a list with 14 items 

# 1. Google



# 2. CRAN


# 3. Bio-Conductor


# 4. GitHub pages


# 5. Rdocumentation


# 6. Crantastic


# 7. rpackages 


# 8. R-opensci


# 9. R-forge


# 10. AwesomeR


# 11. CRAN Task View


# 12. Rstudio-rpackages


# 13. stack overflow - r
