Data set was provided on week 34 for TidyTuesday analysis. As it is Thanksgiving 
week this is understandable. You can receive the data set 
[here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018-11-20/thanksgiving_meals.csv). There are 
more than 65 variables and 1058 observations. The data was acquired buy a survey 
conducted online and information about them are [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018-11-20).

# People who do and do not celebrate Thanksgiving

In this ThanksGiving data set 980 are celebrating, and 78 are not celebrating Thanksgiving. I 
will use plots to understand their composition and tables to explain them further.   

Variables in consideration for this task is none other than Age, Gender, Family Income 
and US regions. Finally my aim is to create animated plots and interactive tables
for the above variables through the help of packages gganimate and kable.

## Age Distribution

First the age distribution has only 4 groups, where people who celebrate Thanksgiving
in the age category of 18-29 is the very least. Highest count goes to the age category 
of 45-59 with 269. There are 33 missing observations and they were removed.

Considering the people who do not celebrate Thanksgiving the least count of 6 goes to 
category of 60+, but here the category of 18-29 has the highest count of 31. No missing
observations were recorded here.

Below is an animated bar plot where the counts change for their respective 4 categories.
As 90% of respondents have answered Yes for celebrating Thanksgiving and rest have answered
No we can clearly see the count differences

```{r Age with do people and do not people,out.width="75%",out.height="75%"}
attach(Thanksgiving_Yes)
attach(Thanksgiving_No)
# people who do not celebrate 
dont_age<-as.data.frame(summary.factor(Thanksgiving_No$age))
# people who do celebrate

# people who do celebrate
data_do_age<-data.frame(group=c("18-29","30-44","45-59","60+"),
                      values=do_age$`summary.factor(na.omit(Thanksgiving_Yes$age))`,
                        frame=rep("Do Celebrate",4))
# people who do not celebrate
data_dont_age<-data.frame(group=c("18-29","30-44","45-59","60+"),
                          values=dont_age$`summary.factor(Thanksgiving_No$age)`,
                          frame=rep("Do not Celebrate",4))
# combining both
data_age<-rbind(data_do_age,data_dont_age)

# animated bar plot for people who do celebrate and who do not celebrate

## Age with Other Factors

First table is Age vs Gender for people who celebrate Thanksgiving. All age categories
have a percentage range in between 19 and 29. Highest percentage of 28.4055 is for Age 
category 45 - 59. Female have a higher percentage of 54.3823. 

Female who are 60+ have the highest percentage of 15.2059, while lowest percentage of 8.7645 
is for male in the age category of 18-29.

  row_spec(5,bold = T,color = "red") %>%
  row_spec(0,bold = T,align = 'center')

detach(Thanksgiving_No)
```

With relative to people who celebrate Thanksgiving in the Family Income category 
highest percentage goes to USD 25,000 to 49,999. 

People who have Family Income USD 25,000 to 49,999 and age above 60 have the highest 
percentage of 4.96, while lowest percentage of 0.11 is for people who have Family 
Income in between USD 175,000 to 199,999 of age category of 18-29.

  row_spec(0,bold = T,angle = 270,align = 'center')

detach(Thanksgiving_Yes)
```

Of people who do not celebrate Thanksgiving the Family Income category has
the highest percentage which goes to People who prefer not to answer.

15 cells in this table are zero which is the lowest percentage that can occur,
while highest percentage goes to people who are in the age category 18 -29 while 
Family Income is USD 0 to 9,999 and prefer not to answer.

```{r Age and Family Income for No People}
attach(Thanksgiving_No)

## Gender Distribution

We have two types of gender categories in this data set which are male and female. 
According to the people who celebrate Thanksgiving 515 are Female, while only 432 
are male. Here also there are 33 missing observations and they have been removed. 

But this is not the case for those who do not celebrate Thanksgiving. Female have a
count of only 29, where males have a count of 49. There were no missing observations.

## Family Income Distribution

There are 11 categories when it comes to Family Income. The option of Prefer
Not to answer is given and has been chosen by people who celebrate and people 
who do not celebrate Thanksgiving.

Considering the people the who celebrate Thanksgiving, highest count of 166 goes
to the category of 25,000 to 49,999 USD. While least count goes to 175,000 to 
199,999 USD and the count is 26. Further, 118 people have chosen not to answer 
this question. 33 Missing observations were removed.

Where as in people who do not celebrate Thanksgiving, second highest count goes to the 
categories of 0 to 9,999 USD and 25,000 to 49,999 USD, where the count is 14. 
Similarly, for the least count of 1 also there are two Family Income categories,
which are 125,000 to 149,999 USD and 175,000 to 199,999 USD. Prefer not to answer
is the choice of 18 respondents who participated in this survey. No missing observations 
were recorded.

As before here also an animated bar plot is used to explain this.

People who do celebrate Thanksgiving have 49 missing values, while only 10 are 
missing values for people who do not celebrate Thanksgiving.

# Conclusion

I shall conclude my findings in point form 

* We can use gganimate to make bar plots interesting and useful.

* kable is very useful because of styling options.

# Further Analysis 

* There are more than 50 variables therefore much more can be done than 
describing the data-set. 

* We can use advanced methods such as clustering and model fitting.

I intend to post more statistics related materials in the future and learn accordingly. Thank you for reading.
