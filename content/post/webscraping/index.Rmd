# Introduction

World Cup matches are now in action as all initial matches are over, while semi-final and final 
matches are to come. Sri Lanka is not in the final four, but not at the bottom as well thankfully
we ended up in sixth place. 

It should be noted that not all world cups are the same, earlier it was 60 overs for a team now it is 50
overs. Two decades ago there were less than 10 teams who played cricket, but now more than 10 teams play
cricket. To be more clear in 2019 Afghanistan is playing in the world cup but not Ireland, Scotland, 
Netherlands, Zimbabwe or Kenya. Further, in late 1990s Duckworth-Lewis method was introduced to avoid 
abandoning matches because of slight drizzle. 

I initially wanted to do a clear analysis on all world cups so far, but as there are clear differences 
among several world-cups I will with hold that for now. Yet, In order to do this Exploratory Data
analysis on World cups we need data. This data is extracted from Espn CricInfo website. 

# Web scraping

This [link](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/series_results.html?id=12;type=trophy)
provides links to all world cups. These individual webpages all have the same format, therefore it is 
easy to extract information from them. 

2019 world cup is unfinished therefore its data format is different from others and with missing
information. Therefore 2019 world cup data is not added here. To extract this information R packages
["rvest"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/), 
["stringr"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html) and
["splitstackshape"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/splitstackshape/index.html) are used. rvest
is for information extraction from webpages, where stringr and splitstackshape are used for manipulating
characters, strings, columns and rows.

Below figure is the layout from the world-cup 1975 page. Also the highlighted area is chosen by me 
with the help of browser extension ["Selector Gadget"](https://selectorgadget.com). This extension
is used to select the css section of a given websites highlighted area.

# Process

1. Using the rvest package we can extract this highlighted information, more knowledge regarding this
can be studied from this 
[blog post](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/beginners-guide-on-web-scraping-in-r-using-rvest-with-hands-on-knowledge/) and
[Vignettes File](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/selectorgadget.html).

Below is the code for data extraction from website, finally we have a character class list
with 22 rows of information.

```{r Code for extracting html information,results='hide'}
# Load the packages
  library(rvest)
  library(stringr)
  library(splitstackshape)

# html link for world cup 1975  
  weblink <- "http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/60793.html"

# extract the webpage information from cricinfo page
  base_url <- weblink
  readpage <- read_html(base_url)
  dialogue <- html_nodes(readpage,'.small-20')
  
# extract the data from html components
  data <- html_text(dialogue)
  class(data)
  str(data)
```

2. The resultant is a long list of Characters, but it could be different according to what you have 
highlighted in the website. 

```{r Data manipulation,results='hide'}
# add the infor into a matrix
  data_mat <- matrix(data)
  # View(data_mat) # view the data
```

![](/webscraping/View_data_mat.JPG)

3. Here, the world cup data of 1975 has multiple rows of information but one column, one row contains 
all the information regarding one match. All the information means match number, who vs who, location, 
winning conditions, number of runs scored, number of wickets taken, number of overs played. 

```{r One row information}
# one row information
  data_mat[4,]
```

4. The difficult part is dividing this one row of information which has similar pattern over rows into
separate columns of meaningful information. Also it should be noted that several rows contain
unnecessary information and they should be removed. Further, each row has latex notations such 
as " ","\n" and "\t", which will be replaced by "-" because already we do have "-". 

```{r transforming the data and replacing notations,results='hide'}
# remove unnecessary rows     
  data_mat_edit <- as.matrix(data_mat[-c((1:3),((dim(data_mat)[1]-3):dim(data_mat)[1]))])
  
# replace \n, \t and " " with - 
  data_mat_rep <- data.frame(str_replace_all(data_mat_edit,c("\n"="-","\t"="-"," "="-")))
  names(data_mat_rep) <- "Column"
  # View(data_mat_rep)
```

![Before -----> After](/webscraping/BeforeAfter1.JPG)

5. It should be noted that being creative is the key part here, thankfully replacing those latex
notations has made it easy to split the one column data frame into multiple columns with the 
help of "cSplit" function. After that we can select only the columns which matters to us 
and make them into a new data-set.

```{r Selecting only few columns and spliting the one column,results='hide'}
# remove the --- patterns and split it into  columns
  data_mat_tab <- cSplit(data_mat_rep,"Column","---")
  data_mat_tab_good <- data_mat_tab[,c(2,5,8,11,12)]
  # View(data_mat_tab_good)
```

![data_mat_tab](/webscraping/data_mat_tab.JPG)

![data_mat_tab_good](/webscraping/data_mat_tab_good.JPG)

Now we have a much better data frame than earlier, which makes a lot sense. 

6. Now is the next part of our data extraction, where we have to extract much more information 
from the last column which is about runs, wickets, overs of both teams. Along the way we can 
manipulate all the columns into losing the "-" notation and cleaning the data-set. 

## a. Extracting matches information and storing it in a separate column after removing ":".

```{r Much more complex data extraction 1,results='hide'}
# acquire information about matches, basically which one and what type
  Matches <- str_remove(data_mat_tab_good$Column_02,":")
  # View(Matches)
```

![Matches](/webscraping/Matches.JPG)

## b. Extracting the Location and finding who vs who. 

```{r Much more complex data extraction 2,results='hide'}
# acquiring who vs who and locations
  WhovsWhos <- data.frame(cSplit(data_mat_tab_good,
                                 "Column_05","-at-")[,c("Column_05_1","Column_05_2")])
  Location <- data.frame(WhovsWhos$Column_05_2)
  WhovsWho <- str_replace(WhovsWhos$Column_05_1,"--","")
  # View(WhovsWhos)
  # View(Location)
  # View(WhovsWho)
```

![Whovswhos--->Location-->WhovsWho](/webscraping/whovswhos.JPG)

## c. Extracting the Date match and winning conditions.

```{r Much more complex data extraction 3,results='hide'}
# acquiring the Date
  Date <- str_replace(str_replace(data_mat_tab_good$Column_08,",",""),"-","")
  # View(Date)

# Information of how wins
  won <- str_replace_all(str_replace(data_mat_tab_good$Column_11,"-",""),"-"," ")
  # View(won)
```

![Date---->won](/webscraping/Dateandwon.JPG)

## d. Information of both teams who played the match into separate columns.

```{r Much more complex data extraction 4,results='hide'}
# match info extracted
  onetwo <- data.frame(cSplit(data_mat_tab_good,
                              "Column_12",";")[,c("Column_12_1","Column_12_2")])
  names(onetwo) <- c("Team1","Team2")
  # View(onetwo)
  
# Team 1 overs and Team 2 overs extracted
  team1_overs <- str_remove(gsub("(?<=\\()[^()]*(?=\\))(*SKIP)(*F)|.", "", 
                                 onetwo$Team1, perl=T),"-ov")
  team2_overs <- str_remove(gsub("(?<=\\()[^()]*(?=\\))(*SKIP)(*F)|.", "", 
                                 onetwo$Team2, perl=T),"-ov")
  # View(team1_overs)
  # View(team2_overs)
  
# Runs of Team 1 and Runs of Team 2 extracted
  Runs1 <- str_match(onetwo$Team1, "\\-(\\d{2,3})")[,2]
  Runs2 <- str_match(onetwo$Team2, "\\-(\\d{2,3})")[,2]
  # View(Runs1)
  # View(Runs2)
  
# Country Name of Team 1 and Country Name of Team 2 extracted
  Team1 <- dplyr::recode_factor(cSplit(onetwo,"Team1","-")$Team1_1,
                                "Sri"="Sri Lanka","West"="West Indies",
                                "South"="South Africa","New"="New Zealand")
  Team2 <- dplyr::recode_factor(cSplit(onetwo,"Team2","-")$Team2_2,
                                "Sri"="Sri Lanka","West"="West Indies",
                                "South"="South Africa","New"="New Zealand")
  # View(Team1)
  # View(Team2)
  
  #wickets1<-
  #wickets2<-
```

![Extracting useful match information](/webscraping/longtable.JPG)

## e. All those seprarte information after extraction now into one data set.

```{r Much more complex data extraction 5,results='hide'}
  output <- cbind.data.frame(Matches,Location,WhovsWho,Date,won,Team1,team1_overs,
                             Runs1,Team2,team2_overs,Runs2)
  # View(output)
```

![Output](/webscraping/output.JPG)

Now we have a clear table output, it is time to extract the data of all world cups(except 2019) 
into separate tables. As I mentioned before not all world cups stay the same in format therefore we 
are going to check these extracted tables for discrepancy. In order to do this extraction I am 
going to write the above code into one function. 

Below are the links for different world cups.

# Links for world cups

```{r World cup Links,results='hide'}
Link1975 <- "http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/60793.html"
Link1979 <- "http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/60806.html"

```

# Function for data extraction of World cup matches

Further, below is the code for extraction of data from html webpages.

```{r WorldCup function for extraction,results='hide'}

  Runs2<-str_match(onetwo$Team2, "\\-(\\d{2,3})")[,2]
  
  # Team 1 and Team 2 extracted
  Team1<-dplyr::recode_factor(cSplit(onetwo,"Team1","-")$Team1_1,"Sri"="Sri Lanka","West"="West Indies",
                       "South"="South Africa","New"="New Zealand")
  Team2<-dplyr::recode_factor(cSplit(onetwo,"Team2","-")$Team2_2,"Sri"="Sri Lanka","West"="West Indies",
                              "South"="South Africa","New"="New Zealand")
  
  # Team 1 and Team 2 wickets extracted
  #wickets1<- will figure this out
  #wickets2<-
    
  output<-cbind.data.frame("Matches" = Matches, "Location" = Location,"WhovsWho" = WhovsWho,"Date" = Date, 
                           "WinningConditions" = won, "Team1" = Team1, "Overs1" = team1_overs, "Runs1" =  Runs1,
                           "Team2" = Team2, "Overs2" = team2_overs, "Runs2" = Runs2)
  
  return(output)
}
```

Using the links above and function developed by me it is possible to extract each world cup information into 
separate dataframes, after a few tweaks(because as I said earlier not all world cups share the same format)
we can generate one grand data-frame.

If we compare these 11 world cups and their matches it is clear that after 1992 it is no longer the same simple 
format. This earlier format has initial matches, semi-finals and at the end final. This format changes to 
initial matches, quarter finals, semi-finals and then only final in later versions. In 1999 this format was renewed
and extra set of matches such as super eights were added but with the removal of quarter finals. This format of super
eights continued in 2003 and 2007 also. Yet in 2011 and 2015 this was changed by the removal of super eight matches, finally
this year all together we do not even have quarter finals. This is the summary of match formats.

Because of these format changes only the first column(Matches) will be affected and as it is a minor change I am going rectify it 
after extracting the data using the WorldCup function. My main intention of this post is to explain how simple extracting 
information from webpages is and I hope it is completed. 

# Summarize

* Extracting information from websites is mainly affected by the selector gadget and its highlighted area. 

* Ensure that you highlight the most sensible part of the webpage and be prepared to think few steps ahead how you are going to
change this css information into a data-frame. 

* If your first attempt creates a complex structure and difficult to construct a clear data-frame do not hesitate to make changes 
in your highlighting process using selector gadget extension in the browser.

* After creating this initial one column data-frame it is purely based on your creative skills to construct the much divided 
meaningful data-frame with multiple columns. This data-frame does not necessarily has to be perfect, but it needs to be more
informative. 

* With the creation of this initial data-frame it is possible to make more intuitive changes for a much clear data-frame.

* That is all the information related to extracting data from web pages.

*THANK YOU*
