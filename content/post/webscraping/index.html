<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>World Cup matches are now in action as all initial matches are over, while semi-final and final
matches are to come. Sri Lanka is not in the final four, but not at the bottom as well thankfully
we ended up in sixth place.</p>
<p>It should be noted that not all world cups are the same, earlier it was 60 overs for a team now it is 50
overs. Two decades ago there were less than 10 teams who played cricket, but now more than 10 teams play
cricket. To be more clear in 2019 Afghanistan is playing in the world cup but not Ireland, Scotland,
Netherlands, Zimbabwe or Kenya. Further, in late 1990s Duckworth-Lewis method was introduced to avoid
abandoning matches because of slight drizzle.</p>
<p>I initially wanted to do a clear analysis on all world cups so far, but as there are clear differences
among several world-cups I will with hold that for now. Yet, In order to do this Exploratory Data
analysis on World cups we need data. This data is extracted from Espn CricInfo website.</p>
</div>
<div id="web-scraping" class="section level1">
<h1>Web scraping</h1>
<p>This <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/series_results.html?id=12;type=trophy">link</a>
provides links to all world cups. These individual webpages all have the same format, therefore it is
easy to extract information from them.</p>
<p>2019 world cup is unfinished therefore its data format is different from others and with missing
information. Therefore 2019 world cup data is not added here. To extract this information R packages
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/">“rvest”</a>,
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html">“stringr”</a> and
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/splitstackshape/index.html">“splitstackshape”</a> are used. rvest
is for information extraction from webpages, where stringr and splitstackshape are used for manipulating
characters, strings, columns and rows.</p>
<p>Below figure is the layout from the world-cup 1975 page. Also the highlighted area is chosen by me
with the help of browser extension <a href="https://selectorgadget.com">“Selector Gadget”</a>. This extension
is used to select the css section of a given websites highlighted area.</p>

<div id="process" class="section level1">
<h1>Process</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Using the rvest package we can extract this highlighted information, more knowledge regarding this
can be studied from this
<a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/beginners-guide-on-web-scraping-in-r-using-rvest-with-hands-on-knowledge/">blog post</a> and

<p>Below is the code for data extraction from website, finally we have a character class list
with 22 rows of information.</p>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Here, the world cup data of 1975 has multiple rows of information but one column, one row contains
all the information regarding one match. All the information means match number, who vs who, location,
winning conditions, number of runs scored, number of wickets taken, number of overs played.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The difficult part is dividing this one row of information which has similar pattern over rows into
separate columns of meaningful information. Also it should be noted that several rows contain
unnecessary information and they should be removed. Further, each row has latex notations such
as " “,”" and “, which will be replaced by”-" because already we do have “-”.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># remove unnecessary rows

</div>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It should be noted that being creative is the key part here, thankfully replacing those latex
notations has made it easy to split the one column data frame into multiple columns with the
help of “cSplit” function. After that we can select only the columns which matters to us
and make them into a new data-set.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># remove the --- patterns and split it into  columns
  data_mat_tab &lt;- cSplit(data_mat_rep,&quot;Column&quot;,&quot;---&quot;)

<p>Now we have a much better data frame than earlier, which makes a lot sense.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Now is the next part of our data extraction, where we have to extract much more information
from the last column which is about runs, wickets, overs of both teams. Along the way we can
manipulate all the columns into losing the “-” notation and cleaning the data-set.</li>

<p>Now we have a clear table output, it is time to extract the data of all world cups(except 2019)
into separate tables. As I mentioned before not all world cups stay the same in format therefore we
are going to check these extracted tables for discrepancy. In order to do this extraction I am
going to write the above code into one function.</p>

<p>Using the links above and function developed by me it is possible to extract each world cup information into
separate dataframes, after a few tweaks(because as I said earlier not all world cups share the same format)
we can generate one grand data-frame.</p>
<p>If we compare these 11 world cups and their matches it is clear that after 1992 it is no longer the same simple
format. This earlier format has initial matches, semi-finals and at the end final. This format changes to
initial matches, quarter finals, semi-finals and then only final in later versions. In 1999 this format was renewed
and extra set of matches such as super eights were added but with the removal of quarter finals. This format of super
eights continued in 2003 and 2007 also. Yet in 2011 and 2015 this was changed by the removal of super eight matches, finally
this year all together we do not even have quarter finals. This is the summary of match formats.</p>

<p>Because of these format changes only the first column(Matches) will be affected and as it is a minor change I am going rectify it
after extracting the data using the WorldCup function. My main intention of this post is to explain how simple extracting
information from webpages is and I hope it is completed.</p>
