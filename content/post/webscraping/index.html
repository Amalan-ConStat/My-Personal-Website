<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>World Cup matches are now in action as all initial matches are over, while semi-final and final
matches are to come. Sri Lanka is not in the final four, but not at the bottom as well thankfully
we ended up in sixth place.</p>
<p>It should be noted that not all world cups are the same, earlier it was 60 overs for a team now it is 50
overs. Two decades ago there were less than 10 teams who played cricket, but now more than 10 teams play
cricket. To be more clear in 2019 Afghanistan is playing in the world cup but not Ireland, Scotland,
Netherlands, Zimbabwe or Kenya. Further, in late 1990s Duckworth-Lewis method was introduced to avoid
abandoning matches because of slight drizzle.</p>
<p>I initially wanted to do a clear analysis on all world cups so far, but as there are clear differences
among several worldcups I will with hold that for now. Yet, In order to do this Exploratory Data
analysis on World cups we need data. This data is extracted from Espn CricInfo website.</p>
</div>
<div id="webscraping" class="section level1">
<h1>Webscraping</h1>
<p>This <a href="http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/series_results.html?id=12;type=trophy">link</a>
provides links to all world cups. These individual webpages all have the same format, therefore it is
easy to extract information from them.</p>
<p>2019 world cup is unfinished therefore its data format is different from others and with missing
information. Therefore 2019 world cup data is not added here. To extract this information R packages
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/">“rvest”</a>,
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html">“stringr”</a> and
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/splitstackshape/index.html">“splitstackshape”</a> are used. rvest
is for information extraction from webpages, where stringr and splitstackshape are used for manipulating
characters, strings, columns and rows.</p>
<p>Below figure is the layout from the worldcup 1975 page. Also the highlighted area is chosen by me
with the help of browser extension <a href="https://selectorgadget.com">“Selector Gadget”</a>. This extension
is used to select the css section of a given websites highlighted area.

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Using the rvest package we can extract this highlighted information, more knowledge regarding this
can be studied from this
<a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/beginners-guide-on-web-scraping-in-r-using-rvest-with-hands-on-knowledge/">blog post</a> and
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/selectorgadget.html">Vignettes File</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The resultant is a long list of Characters, but it could be different according to what you have
highlighted in the website.</p></li>
<li><p>Here, the world cup data of 1975 has multiple rows of information but one column, one row contains
all the information regarding one match. All the information means match number, who vs who, location,
winning conditions, number of runs scored, number of wickets taken, number of overs played.</p></li>
