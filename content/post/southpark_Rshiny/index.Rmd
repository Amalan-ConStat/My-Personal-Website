# Shiny App of Text Analytics for South Park Tv show.

R Shiny Apps are very popular, that is why I developed my first Shiny App based on Olympic Data
from Kaggle. It will be updated after year 2020 Olympic games. Here is the [Link.]()
After this I now developed something grand-eloquent, which is for the long running Tv series
South Park. 

This show has 22 seasons aired until now. I was able to find the data for scripts of all
the aired episodes until season 18 from the GitHub [repository]() 
of [.]() While this was more than enough information I was focusing on getting data for the 
rest of the seasons(19,20,21,22). For this task I briefly studied web scraping and thankfully
it was helpful in obtaining that data with a little amount of knowledge of string manipulation.

Finally I was able to create one massive data set which would have all the script details
from season 1 to season 22 for all episodes with who spoke them and what did these Characters
say without unnecessary background interpretations or scenario desctiptions. 

But this was not the end, because I was lucky enough to find the R package in GitHub
[southparkr](). This package included information from the IMDB website regarding 
Episode Name, Rating and Votes. Further it also included similar information 
regarding the scripts but more thoroughly until recent seasons. Which gave me an idea
to use this package for data regarding the Rating and votes from IMDB because I already
had the information for scripts.
