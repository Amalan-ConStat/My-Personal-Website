# Shiny App of Text Analytics for South Park Tv show.

R Shiny Apps are very popular, that is why I developed my first Shiny App based on Olympic Data
from Kaggle. It will be updated after year 2020 Olympic games. Here is the [Link.]()
After this I now developed something grand-eloquent, which is for the long running TV series
South Park. 

This show has 22 seasons aired until now. I was able to find the data for scripts of all
the aired episodes until season 18 from the GitHub [repository]() 
of [.]() While this was more than enough information I was focusing on getting data for the 
rest of the seasons(19,20,21,22). For this task I briefly studied web scraping and thankfully
it was helpful in obtaining that data with a little amount of knowledge of string manipulation.

Finally I was able to create one massive data set which would have all the script details
from season 1 to season 22 for all episodes with who spoke them and what did these Characters
say without unnecessary background interpretations or scenario descriptions. 

But this was not the end, because I was lucky enough to find the R package in GitHub
[southparkr](). This package included information from the IMDB website regarding 
Episode Name, Rating and Votes. Further it also included similar information 
regarding the scripts but more thoroughly until recent seasons. Which gave me an idea
to use this package for data regarding the Rating and votes from IMDB because I already
had the information for scripts. 

## No Inputs needed to generate Plots or Results

Plots generated here are to summarize so far how the South park season 1 to 22 has changed.
In terms of Swear words, stop words, all words, sentiment and much more. If we focus on 
sentiment analysis it is more clear when you read documents related to 
[AFINN](), 
[bing]() 
and [nrc]().

### Trivia Sub Tab

This tab includes information in plots mainly generated by plotly with some memes from
South Park. So patiently wait until they load, you can scroll through the page and read
stuff.

### Lines Sub Tab

Summarized information for number of lines with relative to seasons, characters and episodes
will be plotted here. 

### Words Sub Tab

Summarized information for number of words with relative to seasons, characters and episodes
will be plotted here. 

### Special Words Sub Tab

Summarized information for words, words without stop words, swear words with relative to 
seasons, characters and episodes will be plotted here. 

### Ratings and Votes from IMDB Sub Tab

### Sentiment Analysis Sub Tab

### Bigram and Trigram Analysis Sub Tab

## Inputs needed from the user to generate Plots and Results

Inputs from user where they can choose their own will be used to generate plots
under these several tabs. Below generated are only plots but nothing more. These
comparisons are mainly about Most number of lines, Most number of words, Most number 
of words without stop words, Swear words and sentiment analysis. 

Sentiment Analysis is related to AFINN, bing and nrc techniques. Further, nrc has subgroups
which are related to 10 different emotions. While AFINN and bing has only two emotions which
are positive and negative.

### Compare Two Seasons Tab.

Two seasons of the users choice will be used to generate plots. It will take some time 
so patiently wait until they are plotted. Where all the users who were from those 
two seasons. 

### Compare Two Characters Tab.

Two Characters of the users choice will be used to generate plots. It will take some time
so patiently wait until they are plotted. All the seasons which they were active.

### Compare Two Characters but Same Season Tab.

Two Characters of the Same Season will be used to generate plots. It will take some time 
so patiently wait until they are plotted. Here, we will not consider characters which were
active in this particular season, rather all Characters which were active throughout all
seasons. Therefore sometimes their might not be meaningful plots.

### Compare Two Seasons but Same Character Tab.

Two Seasons of the Same Character will be used to generate plots. It will take some time so
patiently wait until they are plotted. Here also we are not considering if the chosen
character by the user is active in the chosen two seasons of choice. Therefore sometimes
we might not generate meaningful plots.
