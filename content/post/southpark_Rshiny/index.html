<h1>Shiny App of Text Analytics for South Park Tv show.</h1>
<p>R Shiny Apps are very popular, that is why I developed my first Shiny App based on Olympic Data from Kaggle. It will be updated after year 2020 Olympic games. Here is the <a href="">Link.</a> After this I now developed something grand-eloquent, which is for the long running Tv series South Park.</p>
<p>This show has 22 seasons aired until now. I was able to find the data for scripts of all the aired episodes until season 18 from the GitHub <a href="">repository</a> of <a href="">.</a> While this was more than enough information I was focusing on getting data for the rest of the seasons(19,20,21,22). For this task I briefly studied web scraping and thankfully it was helpful in obtaining that data with a little amount of knowledge of string manipulation.</p>
<p>Finally I was able to create one massive data set which would have all the script details from season 1 to season 22 for all episodes with who spoke them and what did these Characters say without unnecessary background interpretations or scenario desctiptions.</p>
<p>But this was not the end, because I was lucky enough to find the R package in GitHub <a href="">southparkr</a>. This package included information from the IMDB website regarding Episode Name, Rating and Votes. Further it also included similar information regarding the scripts but more thoroughly until recent seasons. Which gave me an idea to use this package for data regarding the Rating and votes from IMDB because I already had the information for scripts.</p>

<h2>No Inputs needed to generate Plots or Results</h2>
<p>Plots generated here are to summarize so far how the South park season 1 to 22 has changed. In terms of Swear words, stop words, all words, sentiment and much more. If we focus on sentiment analysis it is more clear when you read documents related to <a href="">AFINN</a>, <a href="">bing</a> and <a href="">nrc</a>.</p>

<h2>Inputs needed from the user to generate Plots and Results</h2>
<p>Inputs from user where they can choose their own will be used to generate plots under these several tabs. Below generated are only plots but nothing more. These comparisons are mainly about Most number of lines, Most number of words, Most number of words without stop words, Swear words and sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>Sentiment Analysis is related to AFINN, bing and nrc techniques. Further, nrc has subgroups which are related to 10 different emotions. While AFINN and bing has only two emotions which are positive and negative.</p>
