<p>In Twitter I recently observed people tweeting two photos,where under one the caption is “How it started” and the other “How it ended”. I figured why not change this humorous trend to journal articles as well.</p>
<p>We start with an initial submission but after rejections and comments the article might get severely scrutinized. Not always but sometimes this leads to somewhat of a stunning transformation of the research idea. Hence, below I have provided how my initial article for the “fitODBOD” R package has evolved.</p>
