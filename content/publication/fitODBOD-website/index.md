abstract = " Using [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) a genuine website for fitODBOD was generated. There is no extra work to be done here, because pkgdown uses our exisiting man files and vignettes to create this website. It is quie easy and convenient for a user to use this website generated for fitODBOD. Rather than the CRAN or GitHub  versions, which only provides a manual in the website there are clear and concise examples of how functions can be used for researchers"
