[{"authors":null,"categories":["TidyTuesday"],"content":"\rData set was provided on week 34 for TidyTuesday analysis. As it is Thanksgiving week this is understandable. You can receive the data set here. There are more than 65 variables and 1058 observations. The data was acquired buy a survey conducted online and information about them are here.\nThis is my tweet on week 34\nPeople who do and do not celebrate Thanksgiving\rIn this ThanksGiving data set 980 are celebrating, and 78 are not celebrating Thanksgiving. I will use plots to understand their composition and tables to explain them further.\nVariables in consideration for this task is none other than Age, Gender, Family Income and US regions. Finally my aim is to create animated plots and interactive tables for the above variables through the help of packages gganimate and kable.\nAge Distribution\rFirst the age distribution has only 4 groups, where people who celebrate Thanksgiving in the age category of 18-29 is the very least. Highest count goes to the age category of 45-59 with 269. There are 33 missing observations and they were removed.\nConsidering the people who do not celebrate Thanksgiving the least count of 6 goes to category of 60+, but here the category of 18-29 has the highest count of 31. No missing observations were recorded here.\nBelow is an animated bar plot where the counts change for their respective 4 categories. As 90% of respondents have answered Yes for celebrating Thanksgiving and rest have answered No we can clearly see the count differences\n\rAge with Other Factors\rFirst table is Age vs Gender for people who celebrate Thanksgiving. All age categories have a percentage range in between 19 and 29. Highest percentage of 28.4055 is for Age category 45 - 59.

I only focused on Sri Lanka and Malaria deaths over years. I could not find anything else at that time, but over the days I realized it should be worth to see how death rate counts change with different regions which do not have Code variable assigned for the data sets malaria deaths and malaria deaths of age.\nThe Tweet itself.\n\rPackages : ggplot2, ggrepel, ggthemr\rTidyTuesday : week 33\rData: malaria_deaths\rMalaria_deaths_plot: Plot shows the death rate per 100,000 people in Sri Lanka decreasing rapidly from 1996 to 2003 with a drop of 0.89 to 0.29, and by 2016 it reaches 0. While in 2015 this rate is 0.13. Highest death rate was in 1990 with 0.91.\r\r\rData: malaria_deaths_age\rMalaria_deaths_age_plot: There are five categories in concern,where age category 15-49 has the most counts of in the range of 45-50. Second category is Under 5 close to 35 counts, while third category is 50-69 in-between 20-25. It should be noted that this order is for the year 1990. At the end of year 2015 this is not the case, where the categories and counts are 15-49 (close to 10), 50-69 (less than 10), 70 or order(close to 5), under 5(less than 5) and finally 5-14 (close to 0).\r\rMalaria Death count rate can be observed by countries or specific regions given in the data set. There are 9 regions in concern and each of these regions have sub parts or collections of countries. Variables included in this data-set are\n\rEntity - Full name of a country or region it is referred.\rCode - 3 letter ISO code for countries, but for regions there are no values.\rYear - Year range from 1990 to 2016.\rDeaths - Malaria - Sex : Both - Age : Age - Standardized (Rate) (per 100,000 people) - Number of people dead for both sexes per 100,000 people in a standardized age because of Malaria.\r\rI will focus of each region separately, because even inside the same region sub parts can behave differently. The 9 regions are\nSDI Countries\rSaharan Region\rEuropean Countries\rGreat Britain or United Kingdom\rAmerican Region\rAsian Countries\rNorth Africa and Middle East\rOceania Region\rCaribbean and Latin American Countries\r\r\rSDI Countries with Malaria Death Count Rate\rInitially there are 5 sub parts in SDI countries, but we can factor them into three based on their death rate behavior. Some regions are having higher death rate close to 75, while others have lower death rate close to 0.0002.\nFirst group is the sub regions which are having higher death rates than other SDI regions, which are Low SDI and Low-middle SDI countries. Low SDI countries are behaving poorly from 1990 with a 73.78 death rate which reaches it highest peek of 75.88 in 2001 after this death rate gradually declines until 2016 and reaches 37.87.\nThis is not the case for Low middle SDI countries where in 1990 death rate is 19.11 and reaches its peek of 22.01 in 2003 with small fluctuations. After this it gradually and slowly declines until 2016 while finishing in a rate of 15.7.\nSDI countries Middle and High-middle are performing better than the above two regions from 1990 itself. While Middle SDI countries have a very low death rate of close to 1 and periodically it decreases to 0.6 at 2016. To be exact in 1990 the death rate is 0.9274 and decrement occurs with small but unaffected fluctuations and reaches 0.6018 in 2016, which is the lowest point.\nFor High middle SDI countries the death rate in 1990 is 0.1168 and in 1996 it reaches the highest point of 0.1281. After 1996 there clear decrease of death rate which reaches its minimum value of 0.0456 in 2016.\nHigh SDI countries are showing very strong decrease from 1990 it self. While in 1990 the death rate is 0.001387 and by polynomial decreasing by 2016 this reaches the least value of 0.000194.\nIF we do plot all these 5 sub parts of SDI countries on one plot we would not have seen these differences and even if we do use facet grid this is not possible. Therefore, first i did plot all 5 regions together and then sub setted them based on their death rate change in values.\nIt is clear that High SDI values have the lowest death rate and Low, Low middle SDI have the highest death rates over the years 1990 to 2016.\n\rSaharan Region with Malaria Death Count Rate\rThere are 5 sub parts for Saharan region countries, which are Central Sub-Saharan, Eastern Sub-Saharan, Southern Sub-Saharan, Sub-Saharan Western and Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Here though it does not look like we need to separate these regions and plot them as groups. While plotting them as a whole there are clear and interpret-able differences in this line plot.\nCentral Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Sub-Saharan Africa countries behave similarly where they start with death rates respectively 108.67, 118.94. Further this death rate increases and reaches its highest peaks of 138.23 and 121.08 respectively for Western Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Sub-Saharan Africa countries for the year 2003. Finally they decrease into their lowest of 64.64 death rate for Central Sub-Saharan Africa and 87.54 death rate for Western Sub-Saharan Africa.\nSub-Saharan Africa Regions has a higher death rate performance through out the time line when it begins with 89.33 in 1990, and reaches its highest value of 96.28 in 2003. Further death rate decreases slowly up-to 51.93 in 2016, which is the least minimum value. Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa starts with 77.83 in 1990 and reaches its peak of 78.49 in 1991. In the next few years until 2000 there is small fluctuations. Finally there is a steep slope and reaches its lowest death rate value of 23.15 in 2016.\nDeath rate of Southern Sub-Saharan Africa is completely different than above four sub regions of Saharan Africa. In 1990 the death rate is 1.69 and it fluctuates until 2016, but it reaches the highest death rate of 2.57 in 2006. Further with this fluctuation in 2016 the death rate is 2.29 which higher than the previous 7 years from 2016.\nConsidering 1990 and 2016 the biggest decrease occurs for the region of Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa, while the lowest decrease is for Western Sub-Saharan Africa. While in the year gap of 1990 and 2016 only Southern Sub-Saharan Africa has an increase in death rate from 1.69 to 2.29.\n\rEuropean Countries with Malaria Death Count Rate\rI believe that European countries had any malaria related deaths even before 1990, because of their weather patterns. That is simply assured by here in this plot, where there is no deaths for the sub regions of Europe. Which are Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Western Europe.\n\rGreat Britain or United Kingdom with Malaria Death Count Rate\rWe consider the collection of these countries as Great Britain or United Kingdom, which are England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Here also weather pattern do have a high probability in causing a situation of no malaria related deaths. Further, these four countries are close to the European regions in the previous section therefore this assures us more that over the years from 1990 to 2016 the death rate is zero.\n\rAmerican Region with Malaria Death Count Rate\rThere are 5 sub regions for American countries, yet we can divide them into two groups. One group will include Andean, Central and Tropical Latin American countries, and other group includes North America and Southern Latin American countries.\nIn the first group, Andean and Tropical Latin American countries begin with respectively 0.354, 0.351 death rates in 1990. This gradually decreases until 2016 for both regions, but Tropical Latin countries has a better decrement than Andean Latin American countries because they achieve death rate of respectively 0.038 and 0.048.\nIn this same time period of 1990 to 2016, Central Latin American begins with a death rate of 0.296 and reaches its lowest point of 0.053. In year 1994, Tropical Latin American region and Central Latin American region have the same death rate of 0.222. Further in the years 2004 and 2005 the death rates of Andean Latin American countries are 0.089, 0.071, but the same years Central Latin American region has death rates of 0.088, 0.080. Those are the two crucial changes which occur.\nThe second group has North American region and Southern Latin American region. Clearly North America with its cold weather condition and developed status does not hold any deaths for malaria from 1990 to 2016. It is even possible to consider before this time range also there was no deaths for malaria. Yet Southern Latin American has death rate of 0.0208 in 1990 but decreases gradually and reaches its least minimum point of 0.0035 in 2016.\nComparing the American region only North American region is malaria free, while least amount progress has occurred in Central Latin American region. Tropical region has out performed Andean Latin American region. Next to North America, Southern Latin American has done more progress than other three regions.\n\rAsian Countries with Malaria Death Count Rate\rThere are 6 regions in the Asian region, which are Oceania, South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, High Income Asia Pacific, Australasia and Central Asia. Asia is a Large continent with wide variety of countries therefore we have more sub regions than any other continent here.\nSouth Asia and Southeast Asia are two regions which behave similarly where it begins in a higher rate in year 1990 and gradually decreasing until year 2016. South Asia has a death rate of 6.21 in 1990, but in 2016 it reaches to 3.61. For Southeast Asian region the death rate is 5.29 in year 1990 and reaches the death rate of 2.56 in year 2016.\nEast Asia region begins with a death rate of 0.0269 in year 1990 and it decreases over the coming years which will reach the lowest death rate of 0.0121 in year 2015. Further in year 2016 it slightly increases to 0.0122.\nCentral Asia region begins with a a death rate of 0.0304 in year 1990 and increases very slowly until year 1998 of death rate of 0.0314. After this the death rate decreases gradually until year 2013 where it becomes 0.0057. Until year 2016 this becomes the standard death rate for malaria in Central Asia Region.\nHigh Income Asia Pacific countries have a better death rate than previous Asian region countries where in 1990 the death rate is 0.0073 but over the years it decreases gradually and reaches the lowest death rate value of 0.0008 in year 2016.\nAustralasia countries have no death rate over the year range of 1990 to 2016, which implicate that there is a possibility that before 1990 also there could have not been any deaths related to malaria\nAustralasia is the only region which does not have malaria over the years given in the data set. The lowest death rate occurs to High Income Asian Pacific region than other regions of Asia.\n\rNorth Africa and Middle East Region with Death Count Rate\rNorth Africa and Middle East region is the only odd region of all in this data set for malaria death rate. In year 1990 the death rate is 0.7968 but in the coming years it increases until 2005 and reaches 1.3444. Despite this increment after 2005 the death rate suddenly and rapidly drops until year 2011 and reaches its lowest point of 0.731. Again there is a steady but slow increase in death rate and reaches 0.8332 in year 2016.\nComparing all the other region in this data set only North Africa and Middle East Region was very special with its odd fluctuations which are odd. At the end comparing the death rates of year 1990 and 2016 there is an increase close to 0.04, but it is far less than what was in year 2005.\n\rOceania Region with Death Count Rate\rOceania region begins the malaria death rate of 14.78 in 1990, even though it oscillates over the next few years and reaches a death rate of 12.5 in 1998 and in year 2000 it reaches a staggering highest peak of 53.18 death rate. After reaching the highest peak it decreases slowly in the next few years and reaches its lowest point of 8.71 in 2016.\nOceania region behaves very differently than other regions. By the year 2016 highest death rate of 8.71 occurs forOceania region.\n\rCaribbean and Latin America and Caribbean Countries with Death Count Rate\rCaribbean region countries in the 1990 has a malaria death rate of 0.1265, but next year it is 0.1519. Further it decreases over the years with some fluctuations in some years. By year 2016 the death rate reaches 0.058.\nLatin American and Caribbean region countries begin with the death rate of 0.3043 in 1990, but it exponentially decreases until 2016 and reaches 0.0468. In the course it out performs Caribbean countries after year 1999 where Latin American and Caribbean countries occupy a death rate of 0.1282, Caribbean countries occupy a death rate of 0.1274.\nClearly Latin American and Caribbean countries perform better than Caribbean countries after year 1999 until year 2016. At the beginning of 1990 the death rate gap between both these regions are clearly high.\n\rConclusion\rI shall conclude my findings in point form\n\rDeath rate for malaria decreases over the years with small fluctuations over the years and reaches zero in 2016 for Sri Lanka. By 2016 all age categories reach a death count of zero, but in 1990 they are at different parts of the scale.\n\rHigh SDI countries have a low death rate. While Low and Low middle SDI countries have the highest death rates over the years from 1990 to 2016.\n\rIn the Saharan region lowest death rate is for Southern Sub-Saharan region and highest death rate is for Western Sub-Saharan region on the year 2016. This order is same for year 1990 as well in these regions. Highest death rate of all years and all sub regions occurs in year 2003 of 138.23 for Western Sub-Saharan Africa. While lowest death rate of all years and all sub regions is in year 1994 for Southern Sub-Saharan Africa with 1.55.\n\rEuropean and Great Britain related regions have no malaria related incidents over the years of 1990 to 2016, this could be because of their cold climate pattern and their developed status in the world.\n\rNorth America shows figures of no malaria related deaths over the years of 1990 to 2016. Southern Latin America has the lowest death rate of 0.0035 in 2016 and highest death rate is for Central Latin America. But in year 1990 highest death rate is for Andean Latin American region which is 0.354 and least death rate is for Southern Latin America with 0.0208.\n\rAustralasia has no death rate over the years of 1990 to 2016. Where in year 2016 lowest death rate occurs to High Income Asia Pacific of 0.0008 and highest in that year for Oceania region with a value of 8.71. In the year 1990 highest death rate is for Oceania region with 14.78 but lowest is for High Income Asia Pacific region with 0.0073.

Data-sets are uploaded every Tuesday, and plots are published under the #tidytuesday. This is just me presenting a few accumulated plots for the data-set r-downloads.csv and r_downloads_year.csv.\nI shall be focusing on the data set provided on 2018 October 30th, Which is R and Package download stats. My main objective is to understand how Sri Lankan users have behaved in this data-set.\nThe packages used in R are readr,ggplot2, lubridate, ggthemr, gridExtra, magrittr, knitr and kableExtra.\nThere are 701 downloads occurred in between the given time limit of 2017 October 20th to 2018 October 20th in Sri Lanka. Similarly, if we look at the downloads on the day of 2018 October 23rd, which is 3 observations. There are 7 variables to be concerned, which are\n\rdate - date of download (y-m-d)\rtime - time of download (in UTC)\rsize - size in bytes\rversion - R release version\ros - Operating System\rcountry - Two letter ISO country code\rip_id - Anonymized daily ip code(unique identifier)\r\r\rOperating Systems\rWindows is not a favorable operating system for open source programming was my myth. Well, No longer I shall believe that if it is considering Sri Lankans and R programming.\n\r\rOperating System\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\rosx\r\r0.0371\r\r\r\rsrc\r\r0.0271\r\r\r\rwin\r\r0.9358\r\r\r\r\rMajority of users have used Windows which is 93.58%, while Mac users are represented with 3.71% and finally 2.71% from the source file. Next, focusing on the R versions downloaded.\n\rR versions\rVersions are updated regularly for R and a grand update occurred on 2018 April for the version 3.5.0. Further, versions 3.4.3 and 3.4.4 were updated in the time gap considered. There are versions from 3.0.0 and higher for Sri Lankan users. It is crucial to study this where we can understand how far does the user have knowledge about R and updating the software version.\nTable shows that version 3.5.1 represents a 36.52% followed by version 3.4.3 of 27.96% and in the third place version 3.5.0 with 15.98%. Further, all downloads are occurred for versions 3.0.0 or higher than it. People believed in 3.4.3 than 3.5.0, which could only mean that 3.4.3 was more stable for user and package requirements.\n\r\rR Version\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\r3.0.0\r\r0.0014\r\r\r\r3.2.2\r\r0.0014\r\r\r\r3.4.0\r\r0.0014\r\r\r\r3.3.3\r\r0.0029\r\r\r\r3.4.1\r\r0.0029\r\r\r\r3.4.4\r\r0.0899\r\r\r\r3.4.2\r\r0.0956\r\r\r\r3.5.0\r\r0.1598\r\r\r\r3.4.3\r\r0.2796\r\r\r\r3.5.1\r\r0.3652\r\r\r\r\rIf we further divide the operating systems bar plot with respective to R version it is clearly seen that only versions 3.5.1, 3.5.0, 3.4.4, 3.4.3 and 3.4.2 have maintained importance for the windows operating system.\nContingency table for R version vs Operating System\r\r\r\r\r3.0.0\r\r3.2.2\r\r3.3.3\r\r3.4.0\r\r3.4.1\r\r3.4.2\r\r3.4.3\r\r3.4.4\r\r3.5.0\r\r3.5.1\r\r\r\r\r\rosx\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0029\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0100\r\r0.0086\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0071\r\r0.0086\r\r\r\rsrc\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0029\r\r0.0043\r\r0.0057\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0100\r\r\r\rwin\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0813\r\r0.2653\r\r0.0899\r\r0.1512\r\r0.3466\r\r\r\r\rWindows operating system percentages indicate that 34.66% of users have chosen version 3.5.1, 26.53% have chosen version 3.4.3 and finally version 3.5.0 with 15.12%. Close to 9% is represented by version 3.4.2 and 3.4.4.\n\rDate versus Operating System\rDate is a difficult variable in statistics therefore I have disseminated the date into 4 types, which are month(January to December), day(1-31), hour(0-23) and minutes(0-59). Further, I have tried to understand what type of operating systems were used in those time types.\nSo, the first sub part of time is months. Here, we are considering 12 months of an year and months August and April reflects no Operating System is better than Windows property. While, August holding the least amount of downloads with slightly above frequency 20. Highest frequency occurs to October with count higher than 130 and significantly osx and src types of files also have higher amount than any-other month. Except August only the month of December has counts higher than 100.\nNext, focusing on the days it is clear that 10th and 11th have most downloads respectively reaching more than 60 and 70 in counts, while in other days it is mostly less than 30. Further, clearly on the 31st it includes least frequency of 10 because 31st is not a common day of all 12 months. It would be very tiring to focus on operating systems individually, but to be fair there is clear sign of few days with only the use of windows, and a few days with combination of other operating systems with windows.\nI have been curious at this part because of wanting to know at which hour of the day did our Sri Lankan users download R and packages. Yet it should be noted that the hour of time could be local time of Sri Lanka or otherwise. Still according to the bar chart the hours 4th and 5th have most downloads with counts of above 80 and above 90 respectively. Where in the 21st hour it reaches the least amount of less than 5 counts. Most of the frequencies are in the range of 10 and 35.\nLooking at the minutes it is very spread out. Focusing on special occasions only four minutes which are 59th, 46th, 12th and 0th have counts more than 20. While 51st minute has a count of 2. Rather than this nothing more significant occurs here. I think considering these counts in perspective of specific operating systems is tedious amount of work and waste of time.\n\rDownload Size and IP ID\rPackages were downloaded but none of their names were given in this data-set. Therefore we cannot know which package were downloaded. Yet we can identify the package sizes which were downloaded most. According to the table an R package with 82375220 bytes has most downloads of 50, while second place goes to to a size of 82375219 bytes and finally in third place is for 82375216 bytes with 39 counts.\n\r\rSize\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\r82877772\r\r18\r\r\r\r78171328\r\r22\r\r\r\r82375216\r\r39\r\r\r\r82375219\r\r48\r\r\r\r82375220\r\r50\r\r\r\r\rLooking at the IP ID it is clear that 334 has the highest downloads of 55, while second place goes to 1060 with 46 downloads.

There are 202 distributors for movies of four types of ratings which are G, PG, PG-13 and R, but 137 movies have no record of them. Also there are five categories for genre, where Drama with 1236, while horror with 298 movies.\nThere are five types of ratings but around half of them are R rated, while 1094 are PG-13. While 573 are in category of PG and G rated movies are only 85. Finally, 137 movies do not have any ratings.\nComedy movies are mostly R rated(under 17 requires guardian) and PG-13 (some material is inappropriate to under 13). Where the frequencies are respectively 367 and 328. 309 movies of adventure genre could be watched by children with accompanying parents and 67 movies can be watched by all ages.\nYet 645 Drama movies are R-rated.There is only one action movie for general audiences(for all) and obviously no horror film should be watched by children alone, yet there are 7 movies which you can watch with your parents.\nContengency table in counts for Genre versus MPAA Rating\r\r\r\r\rAction\r\rAdventure\r\rComedy\r\rDrama\r\rHorror\r\r\r\r\r\rG\r\r1\r\r67\r\r6\r\r11\r\r0\r\r\r\rPG\r\r34\r\r309\r\r79\r\r144\r\r7\r\r\r\rPG-13\r\r225\r\r83\r\r328\r\r398\r\r58\r\r\r\rR\r\r286\r\r14\r\r367\r\r645\r\r202\r\r\r\r\rWe think horror movies are mostly R-rated then it is true.

Action and Comedy movies have very close percentages for PG-13 ratedness, while 52% are R rated for Action and 47% are comedy.\nPercentage table for Genre versus MPAA Rating\r\r\r\r\rAction\r\rAdventure\r\rComedy\r\rDrama\r\rHorror\r\r\r\r\r\rG\r\r0.00\r\r0.14\r\r0.01\r\r0.01\r\r0.00\r\r\r\rPG\r\r0.06\r\r0.65\r\r0.10\r\r0.12\r\r0.03\r\r\r\rPG-13\r\r0.41\r\r0.18\r\r0.42\r\r0.33\r\r0.22\r\r\r\rR\r\r0.52\r\r0.03\r\r0.47\r\r0.54\r\r0.76\r\r\r\r\rThis data-set contains the release dates from 1956 to 2019. Even though it is not 2019 there is a movie which has been listed here. This explains the domestic and worldwide gross being zero as zero. Then again we have to be careful because there are movies which might not make profit at all, domestic or other wise.\n\rLets Focus of movies which has zero domestic gross\rNo revenue from 66 movies, that is interesting. So obviously Aqua man has a whopping more than 150 million dollars\nproduction budget and no profit because it was not released yet when this data set was compiled. Second rank is for “Wonder park” with 100 million dollars. This movie will be released in 2019.\n\rZero Domestic gross Point of View\rSurprisingly there are movies without any production budget information because I am very sure No movie is done for free. Specially it is odd to see “12 Angry Men” in this list, which leads to the conclusion not all Movies in this list are to be on-it in the first place. We have 66 movies to consider.\n\rGenre and MPAA Rating Point of View\rSo movies with R ratedness have the most count and they are also action and drama genre movies of count 10. Here also there are 11 movies with have not been classified into any rating. Finally, there is no G rated movie in this graphical representation. Majority of movies (31) are from R rated in related to rating. While considering genre the Drama category is represented by 24. Action, Drama and Horror movies includes missing rating.\n\rFinding Outliers in Perspective of Genre and MPAA Rating\rConsidering the box-plot there are 3 outliers in Drama while plotting data in perspective of genre. Most amount of production budget is concluded in Action genre, while the least is in Horror.\nIf we focus on the production budget with genre there are 7 outliers and one action movie has spent 100 million dollars, similarly a movie from adventure category spent more than 100 million dollars. Others production budget is way less than 50 million dollars.\nLeast amount budget is spent on movies of no rating mentioned while most is on PG-13 rated movies and it has one strong outlier. Previously with genre we had 7 outliers but according to MPAA rating there are only 6 outliers.\n\rProduction Budget and Worldwide Gross\rAccording to the ascending order in the list of 10 movies with lowest production budget only 2 have profited. One movie (All the Boys Love Mandy Lane) has considerably done good, but if you consider this list of 10 movies we have 12 angry men as well.\nFirst ten Least production budget movies while Domestic gross is zero\r\r\rMovie Name\r\rProduction Budget\r\rWordlwide Gross\r\rDistributor\r\rMPAA Rating\r\rGenre\r\r\r\r\r\r12 Angry Men\r\r340000\r\r0\r\rUnited Artists\r\rNA\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rMy Beautiful Laundrette\r\r400000\r\r0\r\rOrion Classics\r\rNA\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rEverything Put Together\r\r500000\r\r7890\r\rNA\r\rR\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rAll the Boys Love Mandy Lane\r\r750000\r\r1960521\r\rRadius\r\rR\r\rHorror\r\r\r\rJimmy and Judy\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rOutrider Pictures\r\rR\r\rAction\r\r\r\rThe Poker House\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rPhase 4 Films\r\rR\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rProud\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rCastle Hill Product…\r\rPG\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rSteppin: The Movie\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rWeinstein Co.\r\rPG-13\r\rComedy\r\r\r\rZombies of Mass Destruction\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rAfter Dark\r\rR\r\rComedy\r\r\r\rGrand Theft Parsons\r\r1200000\r\r0\r\rSwipe Films\r\rPG-13\r\rDrama\r\r\r\r\rThis indicates that we didn’t have records how much of profit in home and away properly, because there is no way that people did not watch that movie and not make any gross. So we conclude that some movies which were released before 1970s did not pertain any information of gross domestic or worldwide.\n\rYears, Months and Days versus Production Budget\rThere are 4 Movies before 1972 with zero for domestic gross which can conclude loss of information. Oddly in year 2014 there are 8 movies with zero domestic gross and most of the movies are after year 2000.\nConsidering the months there is no specialty most of the counts are in-between 3 and 8. In January there are only two movies.\nOnly the movies with release dates 19th and 25th have no domestic gross, while highest count of 6 occurs on 21st. Most of the days have the count of 1 movie.\n\rConclusion\rMy conclusion of the above plots and tables in point form\n\rIn the complete data set Drama Genre has most (1236) counts and least (298) count goes to Horror. While, most (1514) of the Movies are R rated, least count goes to Grated movies. Considering Genre and Rating, it is true that Horror movies are R rated while it represents 76%, and should not let children watch alone.\n\rWhile there are movies with No domestic gross some have not been released yet (Aqua man and Wonder Park). Further, some Movies do not even have worldwide gross. This causes missing information. Even though a famous movies such as “12 Angry Men”.\n\rThis missing information could be the related to the fact that there are 4 movies which were released before 1972. Oddly in 2014 there are 8 movies which do not contain domestic gross information. Further, most of these movies were released after year 2000.\n\rBox plot indicates Adventure genre have spent more range in production budget, while in perspective of MPAA rating PG-13 movies have most range in production budget with a clear outlier.\n\r\r\rFurther Analysis\r\rSimilarly we can focus on movies of world wide gross equals to zero with other variables.\n\rConduct scrutinized interest with movies of world wide gross zero and domestic gross zero.\n\r\rPlease see that This is my first post on the internet so please be kind to tolerate my mistakes in grammar and spellings.

Rather than the CRAN or GitHub  versions, which only provides a manual in the website there are clear and concise examples of how functions can be used for researchers","tags":["package","R","CRAN","fitODBOD","GitHub","Website"],"title":"Website-fitODBOD: fitting Over Dispersed Binomial Outcome Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.Amalan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536969600,"objectID":"65a60044eeb2d2c5c9baaf4583c37a9a","permalink":"/publication/fitodbod-github/","publishdate":"2018-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fitodbod-github/","section":"publication","summary":" GitHub version is there for version 1.2.0 with is maintained by me if issues are raised regarding the package.

Modeling such data relative to Binomial Mixture Distributions were discussed because Binomial distribution fails to model the data. The reason is actual observed variance of the data is greater than the assumed theoretical variance, which is defined as over dispersion. fitODBOD package has two versions until October 2018, but in the future there will be updates regularly each year. Whenever there are new distributions to model BOD the new versions will include these distributions. Further, if there are new techniques to make these distributions more useful they will be also added as functions. Version 1.1.0 was published in February 2018 and Version 1.20 was released in September 2018 with two new distributions.","tags":["package","R","CRAN","fitODBOD"],"title":"CRAN-fitODBOD: fitting Over Dispersed Binomial Outcome Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.Amalan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519689600,"objectID":"60b94c34fc45f1e50db023bee5de657a","permalink":"/publication/4th-year/","publishdate":"2018-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/4th-year/","section":"publication","summary":"This is a least viable product of R package for fitting Binomial outcome data, and an abstract, extended articles were written in related to this minimum viable product.","tags":["package","R","CRAN","fitODBOD"],"title":"R Package Development to Model Over Dispersed Binomial Outcome Data with the use of Binomial Mixture Distributions and Alternate Binomial Distributions.","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.
