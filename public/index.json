[{"authors":null,"categories":["TidyTuesday"],"content":"Bridge Data and Baltimore\rData for the analysis and description about the Baltimore bridges are hyper-linked. Further , my tweet is also in this hyperlink.\nData on bridges is of week 35 from TidyTuesday. Trying to explain the data using maps is obvious, yet I will use animated jitter plots. There are 13 variables and 2079 observations. Brave choice of limiting my self to less than 10 variables, where latitude, longitude and Vehicles will not be taken into account.\nSo with the help of packages tidyverse, ggthemr, gganimate,formattable and readr I will complete this analysis. Most of the bridges are owned by several agencies, but I will only focus on the top three ownership holders.\nCounties which have bridges owned by State Highway Agency\rClose to 1000 bridges are owned by State Highway Agency, where most of them are in Baltimore County. High amount of bridges are in good condition, further more bridges are in Fair condition and only around 10 bridges in Poor condition.\nConsidering the Average Daily Traffic only one bridge in Poor condition has the amount of close to 110,000, while all the other poor condition bridges have Average Daily Traffic less than 30,000. While counties Anne Arundel and Hartford have no Poor condition bridges at all.\nMost of the bridges are from Baltimore County and around 20 bridges have count of more than 150,000 Average Daily Traffic for both Fair and Good conditions. Hartford and Carroll Counties have their Average Daily Traffic which does not exceed 80,000 at any condition of the bridge.\n\rCounties which have bridges owned by County Highway Agency\rCounty Highway Agency owns the second most amount of bridges in this data-set. Therefore using jitter plots we are going to check how the condition of the bridges and counties are explained in the simplest manner.\nLess amount of poor condition bridges in all counties except Anne Roundel County. All bridges owned by County Highway Agency have a limited Average Daily Traffic less than 50,000. Clearly we have more Fair bridges than Good ones. In the Poor condition category only two have Average Daily Traffic more than 20,000, while other two have more than 10 bridges.\nMost of these bridges are in Baltimore County even it is in any one of three conditions. There are few bridges which have values more than 40,000 Average Daily Traffic and they are also in Baltimore County.\nThere are bridges which have Zero Average Daily Traffic. In all three Conditions only Hartford County has bridges which has Average Daily Traffic less than 10,000.\n\rCounties which have bridges owned by State Toll Authority\rThere is only bridge which is in Poor condition and it is in Baltimore County, while counties Howard and Anne Arundel have no Good condition bridges. Further there is only 3 Fair condition bridges in Howard County while they have values for Average Daily Traffic less than 10,000.\nThe highest Average Daily Traffic is close to 170,000 which are only 4 and are in Good and Fair conditions. Further, Anne Arundel County has only one Good bridge and in Hartford it is six bridges. Only few of the bridges have Average Daily Traffic close to zero.\n\rMost amount of bridges Built based on Year\rYears 1957, 1970, 1975, 1991, 1963 and 1961 have the top 6 spots for building more than 50 bridges in those years. If we consider the conditions of Fair and Good only the year 1991 is suitable to be mentioned, while all other years has at-least one Poor condition bridge. Further There are more Poor condition bridges in 1961 than in 1957. While all Poor condition bridges has Average Daily Traffic less than 50,000.\nFinally, there are only few bridges which have Average Daily Traffic above 100,000 and only 3 are in Good condition. There are Bridges which can have Average Daily Traffic close to zero in all 6 years and all conditions.\n\rAverage Traffic Less than or equal to 100,000 for Counties with Bridge Condition\rWhile obtaining summary for county variable there is one issue because there are two observations which say “Baltimore city” than “Baltimore City” and I don’t want to change them.\nIf we focus on Average Daily Traffic less than or equal to 100,000 based on County and Condition. It is clear that Poor condition bridges are part of this criteria and mostly Average Daily Traffic is less than 5000 for Counties Howard, Hartford and Carroll. While Baltimore County has highest amount up-to 75,000, but Baltimore County has highest amount close to 40,000 for Average Daily Traffic. Finally Anne Arundel County has only one Poor condition bridge which has Average Daily Traffic close to zero.\nWe can see that there are more Fair Condition bridges than Good ones. In Baltimore County most of the Fair condition bridges have Average Daily Traffic less than 15000. Similarly Carroll county and Hartford county also behave under such criteria. But for Good condition bridges this is not the case where there is no certain strong dense region as similar to Fair condition bridges.\nPreviously when we looked into county we did not see Baltimore City often as a factor, but here that is not the case.\n\rAverage Traffic More than 100,000 for Counties with Bridge Condition\rThis Jitter plot is completely different than previous one, because there are no clear dense regions for any counties and conditions of the bridge. There is only one Poor condition bridge in Baltimore County where the Average Daily Traffic is close to 115,000. In Fair condition bridges also Baltimore County holds the most, while they are slightly dense in the region of 175,000 to 190,000. while for Howard County similar density occurs between 190,000 to 205,000. Bridges in Good condition have more higher values in Baltimore County than Anne Arundel County.\n\rImprovement and Bridge Conditions with Counties\rIn the variable of Total Improvement there are 1438 missing values, 42 values are zero and the rest are actual values. I am going to look at Total Improvement in two tables. First table will include where Bridges have Total Improvement higher than 9,999,000 and less than 30,000,000. Second table is for Bridges which have Total Improvement higher than or equal to 30,000,000.\nFurther to make these tables interesting I will be using the package formattable, and colors and tiles for numerical values. In the first table there are 7 bridges while only Anne Arundel County holds 3 and Baltimore City holds 4. One bridge is from 1953, and others are from the period of 1977 to 1983. Conditions of these bridges are mostly Fair and two bridges are in Good condition. Lowest Average Daily Traffic is 11760, while highest is 124193, where both bridges are in Fair Condition, and the amount spent on them for Total Improvement are respectively 18,163,000 and 16,264,000. The bridge with Highest amount of Average Daily traffic is built in 1953.\n\r\rCounty\r\rCarries\r\rYear Built\r\rCondition\r\rAverage Daily Traffic\r\rTotal Improvement\r\r\r\r\r\rAnne Arundel County\r\rMD 2\r\r1983\r\rFair\r\r53221\r\r13504\r\r\r\rAnne Arundel County\r\rUS 50\r\r1953\r\rFair\r\r124193\r\r16264\r\r\r\rAnne Arundel County\r\rUPPER LEVEL ROADWA\r\r1977\r\rFair\r\r11760\r\r18163\r\r\r\rBaltimore City \r\rIS 95 SB\r\r1977\r\rFair\r\r94765\r\r15785\r\r\r\rBaltimore City \r\rIS 95 VIADUCT SB\r\r1980\r\rGood\r\r63650\r\r16051\r\r\r\rBaltimore City \r\rIS 95 VIADUCT NB\r\r1980\r\rFair\r\r52850\r\r20484\r\r\r\rBaltimore City \r\rIS 95 SB\r\r1980\r\rGood\r\r55621\r\r20484\r\r\r\r\rWhen I did try to plot the top ten bridges with most Total improvement values there was one issue, which is the distance between first two values and the next 8 values. Therefore I divided the table into two.\nIn this second table We can see there are two bridges which are from Baltimore City and are built in 1980 and 1971, but the amount spent on Total Improvement is 300,000,000 each. But their Average Daily Traffic is respectively 56280 and 30600.\nWhile we have another bridge from Baltimore City and built in 1907, but Total Improvement amount is 35,026,000. Here, the Average Daily Traffic is 3900.\n\r\rCounty\r\rCarries\r\rYear Built\r\rCondition\r\rAverage Daily Traffic\r\rTotal Improvement\r\r\r\r\r\rBaltimore City\r\rUS 40 EDMONDSON AV\r\r1907\r\rPoor\r\r3900\r\r35026\r\r\r\rBaltimore City\r\rIS 95 VIADUCT SB\r\r1980\r\rFair\r\r56280\r\r300000\r\r\r\rBaltimore City\r\rEASTERN AVENUE\r\r1971\r\rFair\r\r30600\r\r300000\r\r\r\r\r\r\rConclusion\rMy conclusion of the above plots and tables in point form\n\rJitter plots and animation are useful in explaining one continuous variable with multiple categorical variables.\n\rSub-setting the data set and applying formattable package is useful to explain different continuous values with in a table.\n\r\r\rFurther Analysis\r\rSimilarly we can use mapping to point out the locations of the bridges and use animation to make it more clear.\r\rPlease see that\nThis is my fifth post on the internet so please be kind to tolerate my mistakes in grammar and spellings.

I will use plots to understand their composition and tables to explain them further.\nVariables in consideration for this task is none other than Age, Gender, Family Income and US regions. Finally my aim is to create animated plots and interactive tables for the above variables through the help of packages gganimate and kable.\nAge Distribution\rFirst the age distribution has only 4 groups, where people who celebrate Thanksgiving in the age category of 18-29 is the very least. Highest count goes to the age category of 45-59 with 269. There are 33 missing observations and they were removed.\nConsidering the people who do not celebrate Thanksgiving the least count of 6 goes to category of 60+, but here the category of 18-29 has the highest count of 31. No missing observations were recorded here.\nBelow is an animated bar plot where the counts change for their respective 4 categories.

While least count goes to 175,000 to 199,999 USD and the count is 26. Further, 118 people have chosen not to answer this question. 33 Missing observations were removed.\nWhere as in people who do not celebrate Thanksgiving, second highest count goes to the categories of 0 to 9,999 USD and 25,000 to 49,999 USD, where the count is 14. Similarly, for the least count of 1 also there are two Family Income categories, which are 125,000 to 149,999 USD and 175,000 to 199,999 USD. Prefer not to answer is the choice of 18 respondents who participated in this survey.

I only focused on Sri Lanka and Malaria deaths over years. I could not find anything else at that time, but over the days I realized it should be worth to see how death rate counts change with different regions which do not have Code variable assigned for the data sets malaria deaths and malaria deaths of age.\nThe Tweet itself.\n\rPackages : ggplot2, ggrepel, ggthemr\rTidyTuesday : week 33\rData: malaria_deaths\rMalaria_deaths_plot: Plot shows the death rate per 100,000 people in Sri Lanka decreasing rapidly from 1996 to 2003 with a drop of 0.89 to 0.29, and by 2016 it reaches 0. While in 2015 this rate is 0.13. Highest death rate was in 1990 with 0.91.\r\r\rData: malaria_deaths_age\rMalaria_deaths_age_plot: There are five categories in concern,where age category 15-49 has the most counts of in the range of 45-50. Second category is Under 5 close to 35 counts, while third category is 50-69 in-between 20-25. It should be noted that this order is for the year 1990. At the end of year 2015 this is not the case, where the categories and counts are 15-49 (close to 10), 50-69 (less than 10), 70 or order(close to 5), under 5(less than 5) and finally 5-14 (close to 0).\r\rMalaria Death count rate can be observed by countries or specific regions given in the data set. There are 9 regions in concern and each of these regions have sub parts or collections of countries. Variables included in this data-set are\n\rEntity - Full name of a country or region it is referred.\rCode - 3 letter ISO code for countries, but for regions there are no values.\rYear - Year range from 1990 to 2016.\rDeaths - Malaria - Sex : Both - Age : Age - Standardized (Rate) (per 100,000 people) - Number of people dead for both sexes per 100,000 people in a standardized age because of Malaria.\r\rI will focus of each region separately, because even inside the same region sub parts can behave differently. The 9 regions are\nSDI Countries\rSaharan Region\rEuropean Countries\rGreat Britain or United Kingdom\rAmerican Region\rAsian Countries\rNorth Africa and Middle East\rOceania Region\rCaribbean and Latin American Countries\r\r\rSDI Countries with Malaria Death Count Rate\rInitially there are 5 sub parts in SDI countries, but we can factor them into three based on their death rate behavior. Some regions are having higher death rate close to 75, while others have lower death rate close to 0.0002.\nFirst group is the sub regions which are having higher death rates than other SDI regions, which are Low SDI and Low-middle SDI countries. Low SDI countries are behaving poorly from 1990 with a 73.78 death rate which reaches it highest peek of 75.88 in 2001 after this death rate gradually declines until 2016 and reaches 37.87.\nThis is not the case for Low middle SDI countries where in 1990 death rate is 19.11 and reaches its peek of 22.01 in 2003 with small fluctuations. After this it gradually and slowly declines until 2016 while finishing in a rate of 15.7.\nSDI countries Middle and High-middle are performing better than the above two regions from 1990 itself. While Middle SDI countries have a very low death rate of close to 1 and periodically it decreases to 0.6 at 2016. To be exact in 1990 the death rate is 0.9274 and decrement occurs with small but unaffected fluctuations and reaches 0.6018 in 2016, which is the lowest point.\nFor High middle SDI countries the death rate in 1990 is 0.1168 and in 1996 it reaches the highest point of 0.1281. After 1996 there clear decrease of death rate which reaches its minimum value of 0.0456 in 2016.\nHigh SDI countries are showing very strong decrease from 1990 it self. While in 1990 the death rate is 0.001387 and by polynomial decreasing by 2016 this reaches the least value of 0.000194.\nIF we do plot all these 5 sub parts of SDI countries on one plot we would not have seen these differences and even if we do use facet grid this is not possible. Therefore, first i did plot all 5 regions together and then sub setted them based on their death rate change in values.\nIt is clear that High SDI values have the lowest death rate and Low, Low middle SDI have the highest death rates over the years 1990 to 2016.\n\rSaharan Region with Malaria Death Count Rate\rThere are 5 sub parts for Saharan region countries, which are Central Sub-Saharan, Eastern Sub-Saharan, Southern Sub-Saharan, Sub-Saharan Western and Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Here though it does not look like we need to separate these regions and plot them as groups. While plotting them as a whole there are clear and interpret-able differences in this line plot.\nCentral Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Sub-Saharan Africa countries behave similarly where they start with death rates respectively 108.67, 118.94. Further this death rate increases and reaches its highest peaks of 138.23 and 121.08 respectively for Western Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Sub-Saharan Africa countries for the year 2003. Finally they decrease into their lowest of 64.64 death rate for Central Sub-Saharan Africa and 87.54 death rate for Western Sub-Saharan Africa.\nSub-Saharan Africa Regions has a higher death rate performance through out the time line when it begins with 89.33 in 1990, and reaches its highest value of 96.28 in 2003. Further death rate decreases slowly up-to 51.93 in 2016, which is the least minimum value. Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa starts with 77.83 in 1990 and reaches its peak of 78.49 in 1991. In the next few years until 2000 there is small fluctuations. Finally there is a steep slope and reaches its lowest death rate value of 23.15 in 2016.\nDeath rate of Southern Sub-Saharan Africa is completely different than above four sub regions of Saharan Africa. In 1990 the death rate is 1.69 and it fluctuates until 2016, but it reaches the highest death rate of 2.57 in 2006. Further with this fluctuation in 2016 the death rate is 2.29 which higher than the previous 7 years from 2016.\nConsidering 1990 and 2016 the biggest decrease occurs for the region of Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa, while the lowest decrease is for Western Sub-Saharan Africa. While in the year gap of 1990 and 2016 only Southern Sub-Saharan Africa has an increase in death rate from 1.69 to 2.29.\n\rEuropean Countries with Malaria Death Count Rate\rI believe that European countries had any malaria related deaths even before 1990, because of their weather patterns. That is simply assured by here in this plot, where there is no deaths for the sub regions of Europe. Which are Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Western Europe.\n\rGreat Britain or United Kingdom with Malaria Death Count Rate\rWe consider the collection of these countries as Great Britain or United Kingdom, which are England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Here also weather pattern do have a high probability in causing a situation of no malaria related deaths. Further, these four countries are close to the European regions in the previous section therefore this assures us more that over the years from 1990 to 2016 the death rate is zero.\n\rAmerican Region with Malaria Death Count Rate\rThere are 5 sub regions for American countries, yet we can divide them into two groups. One group will include Andean, Central and Tropical Latin American countries, and other group includes North America and Southern Latin American countries.\nIn the first group, Andean and Tropical Latin American countries begin with respectively 0.354, 0.351 death rates in 1990. This gradually decreases until 2016 for both regions, but Tropical Latin countries has a better decrement than Andean Latin American countries because they achieve death rate of respectively 0.038 and 0.048.\nIn this same time period of 1990 to 2016, Central Latin American begins with a death rate of 0.296 and reaches its lowest point of 0.053. In year 1994, Tropical Latin American region and Central Latin American region have the same death rate of 0.222. Further in the years 2004 and 2005 the death rates of Andean Latin American countries are 0.089, 0.071, but the same years Central Latin American region has death rates of 0.088, 0.080. Those are the two crucial changes which occur.\nThe second group has North American region and Southern Latin American region. Clearly North America with its cold weather condition and developed status does not hold any deaths for malaria from 1990 to 2016. It is even possible to consider before this time range also there was no deaths for malaria. Yet Southern Latin American has death rate of 0.0208 in 1990 but decreases gradually and reaches its least minimum point of 0.0035 in 2016.\nComparing the American region only North American region is malaria free, while least amount progress has occurred in Central Latin American region. Tropical region has out performed Andean Latin American region. Next to North America, Southern Latin American has done more progress than other three regions.\n\rAsian Countries with Malaria Death Count Rate\rThere are 6 regions in the Asian region, which are Oceania, South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, High Income Asia Pacific, Australasia and Central Asia. Asia is a Large continent with wide variety of countries therefore we have more sub regions than any other continent here.\nSouth Asia and Southeast Asia are two regions which behave similarly where it begins in a higher rate in year 1990 and gradually decreasing until year 2016. South Asia has a death rate of 6.21 in 1990, but in 2016 it reaches to 3.61. For Southeast Asian region the death rate is 5.29 in year 1990 and reaches the death rate of 2.56 in year 2016.\nEast Asia region begins with a death rate of 0.0269 in year 1990 and it decreases over the coming years which will reach the lowest death rate of 0.0121 in year 2015. Further in year 2016 it slightly increases to 0.0122.\nCentral Asia region begins with a a death rate of 0.0304 in year 1990 and increases very slowly until year 1998 of death rate of 0.0314. After this the death rate decreases gradually until year 2013 where it becomes 0.0057. Until year 2016 this becomes the standard death rate for malaria in Central Asia Region.\nHigh Income Asia Pacific countries have a better death rate than previous Asian region countries where in 1990 the death rate is 0.0073 but over the years it decreases gradually and reaches the lowest death rate value of 0.0008 in year 2016.\nAustralasia countries have no death rate over the year range of 1990 to 2016, which implicate that there is a possibility that before 1990 also there could have not been any deaths related to malaria\nAustralasia is the only region which does not have malaria over the years given in the data set. The lowest death rate occurs to High Income Asian Pacific region than other regions of Asia.\n\rNorth Africa and Middle East Region with Death Count Rate\rNorth Africa and Middle East region is the only odd region of all in this data set for malaria death rate. In year 1990 the death rate is 0.7968 but in the coming years it increases until 2005 and reaches 1.3444. Despite this increment after 2005 the death rate suddenly and rapidly drops until year 2011 and reaches its lowest point of 0.731. Again there is a steady but slow increase in death rate and reaches 0.8332 in year 2016.\nComparing all the other region in this data set only North Africa and Middle East Region was very special with its odd fluctuations which are odd. At the end comparing the death rates of year 1990 and 2016 there is an increase close to 0.04, but it is far less than what was in year 2005.\n\rOceania Region with Death Count Rate\rOceania region begins the malaria death rate of 14.78 in 1990, even though it oscillates over the next few years and reaches a death rate of 12.5 in 1998 and in year 2000 it reaches a staggering highest peak of 53.18 death rate. After reaching the highest peak it decreases slowly in the next few years and reaches its lowest point of 8.71 in 2016.\nOceania region behaves very differently than other regions. By the year 2016 highest death rate of 8.71 occurs forOceania region.\n\rCaribbean and Latin America and Caribbean Countries with Death Count Rate\rCaribbean region countries in the 1990 has a malaria death rate of 0.1265, but next year it is 0.1519. Further it decreases over the years with some fluctuations in some years. By year 2016 the death rate reaches 0.058.\nLatin American and Caribbean region countries begin with the death rate of 0.3043 in 1990, but it exponentially decreases until 2016 and reaches 0.0468. In the course it out performs Caribbean countries after year 1999 where Latin American and Caribbean countries occupy a death rate of 0.1282, Caribbean countries occupy a death rate of 0.1274.\nClearly Latin American and Caribbean countries perform better than Caribbean countries after year 1999 until year 2016. At the beginning of 1990 the death rate gap between both these regions are clearly high.\n\rConclusion\rI shall conclude my findings in point form\n\rDeath rate for malaria decreases over the years with small fluctuations over the years and reaches zero in 2016 for Sri Lanka. By 2016 all age categories reach a death count of zero, but in 1990 they are at different parts of the scale.\n\rHigh SDI countries have a low death rate. While Low and Low middle SDI countries have the highest death rates over the years from 1990 to 2016.\n\rIn the Saharan region lowest death rate is for Southern Sub-Saharan region and highest death rate is for Western Sub-Saharan region on the year 2016. This order is same for year 1990 as well in these regions. Highest death rate of all years and all sub regions occurs in year 2003 of 138.23 for Western Sub-Saharan Africa. While lowest death rate of all years and all sub regions is in year 1994 for Southern Sub-Saharan Africa with 1.55.\n\rEuropean and Great Britain related regions have no malaria related incidents over the years of 1990 to 2016, this could be because of their cold climate pattern and their developed status in the world.\n\rNorth America shows figures of no malaria related deaths over the years of 1990 to 2016. Southern Latin America has the lowest death rate of 0.0035 in 2016 and highest death rate is for Central Latin America. But in year 1990 highest death rate is for Andean Latin American region which is 0.354 and least death rate is for Southern Latin America with 0.0208.\n\rAustralasia has no death rate over the years of 1990 to 2016. Where in year 2016 lowest death rate occurs to High Income Asia Pacific of 0.0008 and highest in that year for Oceania region with a value of 8.71. In the year 1990 highest death rate is for Oceania region with 14.78 but lowest is for High Income Asia Pacific region with 0.0073. A special occurrence where comparing all the regions and years the highest death rate is for Oceania Region in year 2000.\n\rHighest death rate occurs in year 2005 for North Africa and Middle East region, but in 1990 the malaria death rate is 0.7968. Further in 2011 it hits the lowest value of 0.731 and finally moves up-to 0.8332 in year 2016.\n\rIn year 1990 Caribbean region has a lower death rate than Latin American and Caribbean region. But this gap gradually decreases over time and by year 2016 Caribbean region reaches a death rate of 0.058 while Latin America and Caribbean region occupies the rate of 0.0468.\n\r\r\rFurther Analysis\r\rThis article only focuses on the death rate but we can expand it to countries and compare them over continents.\n\rIt is possible to consider the age category and compare the death counts of different regions to understand further of these regions.\n\r\rPlease see that\nThis is my third post on the internet so please be kind to tolerate my mistakes in grammar and spellings. I intend to post more statistics related materials in the future and learn accordingly.

Data-sets are uploaded every Tuesday, and plots are published under the #tidytuesday. This is just me presenting a few accumulated plots for the data-set r-downloads.csv and r_downloads_year.csv.\nI shall be focusing on the data set provided on 2018 October 30th, Which is R and Package download stats. My main objective is to understand how Sri Lankan users have behaved in this data-set.\nThe packages used in R are readr,ggplot2, lubridate, ggthemr, gridExtra, magrittr, knitr and kableExtra.\nThere are 701 downloads occurred in between the given time limit of 2017 October 20th to 2018 October 20th in Sri Lanka. Similarly, if we look at the downloads on the day of 2018 October 23rd, which is 3 observations. There are 7 variables to be concerned, which are\n\rdate - date of download (y-m-d)\rtime - time of download (in UTC)\rsize - size in bytes\rversion - R release version\ros - Operating System\rcountry - Two letter ISO country code\rip_id - Anonymized daily ip code(unique identifier)\r\r\rOperating Systems\rWindows is not a favorable operating system for open source programming was my myth. Well, No longer I shall believe that if it is considering Sri Lankans and R programming.\n\r\rOperating System\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\rosx\r\r0.0371\r\r\r\rsrc\r\r0.0271\r\r\r\rwin\r\r0.9358\r\r\r\r\rMajority of users have used Windows which is 93.58%, while Mac users are represented with 3.71% and finally 2.71% from the source file. Next, focusing on the R versions downloaded.\n\rR versions\rVersions are updated regularly for R and a grand update occurred on 2018 April for the version 3.5.0. Further, versions 3.4.3 and 3.4.4 were updated in the time gap considered. There are versions from 3.0.0 and higher for Sri Lankan users. It is crucial to study this where we can understand how far does the user have knowledge about R and updating the software version.\nTable shows that version 3.5.1 represents a 36.52% followed by version 3.4.3 of 27.96% and in the third place version 3.5.0 with 15.98%. Further, all downloads are occurred for versions 3.0.0 or higher than it. People believed in 3.4.3 than 3.5.0, which could only mean that 3.4.3 was more stable for user and package requirements.\n\r\rR Version\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\r3.0.0\r\r0.0014\r\r\r\r3.2.2\r\r0.0014\r\r\r\r3.4.0\r\r0.0014\r\r\r\r3.3.3\r\r0.0029\r\r\r\r3.4.1\r\r0.0029\r\r\r\r3.4.4\r\r0.0899\r\r\r\r3.4.2\r\r0.0956\r\r\r\r3.5.0\r\r0.1598\r\r\r\r3.4.3\r\r0.2796\r\r\r\r3.5.1\r\r0.3652\r\r\r\r\rIf we further divide the operating systems bar plot with respective to R version it is clearly seen that only versions 3.5.1, 3.5.0, 3.4.4, 3.4.3 and 3.4.2 have maintained importance for the windows operating system.\nContingency table for R version vs Operating System\r\r\r\r\r3.0.0\r\r3.2.2\r\r3.3.3\r\r3.4.0\r\r3.4.1\r\r3.4.2\r\r3.4.3\r\r3.4.4\r\r3.5.0\r\r3.5.1\r\r\r\r\r\rosx\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0029\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0100\r\r0.0086\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0071\r\r0.0086\r\r\r\rsrc\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0029\r\r0.0043\r\r0.0057\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0100\r\r\r\rwin\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0813\r\r0.2653\r\r0.0899\r\r0.1512\r\r0.3466\r\r\r\r\rWindows operating system percentages indicate that 34.66% of users have chosen version 3.5.1, 26.53% have chosen version 3.4.3 and finally version 3.5.0 with 15.12%. Close to 9% is represented by version 3.4.2 and 3.4.4.\n\rDate versus Operating System\rDate is a difficult variable in statistics therefore I have disseminated the date into 4 types, which are month(January to December), day(1-31), hour(0-23) and minutes(0-59). Further, I have tried to understand what type of operating systems were used in those time types.\nSo, the first sub part of time is months. Here, we are considering 12 months of an year and months August and April reflects no Operating System is better than Windows property. While, August holding the least amount of downloads with slightly above frequency 20. Highest frequency occurs to October with count higher than 130 and significantly osx and src types of files also have higher amount than any-other month. Except August only the month of December has counts higher than 100.\nNext, focusing on the days it is clear that 10th and 11th have most downloads respectively reaching more than 60 and 70 in counts, while in other days it is mostly less than 30. Further, clearly on the 31st it includes least frequency of 10 because 31st is not a common day of all 12 months. It would be very tiring to focus on operating systems individually, but to be fair there is clear sign of few days with only the use of windows, and a few days with combination of other operating systems with windows.\nI have been curious at this part because of wanting to know at which hour of the day did our Sri Lankan users download R and packages. Yet it should be noted that the hour of time could be local time of Sri Lanka or otherwise. Still according to the bar chart the hours 4th and 5th have most downloads with counts of above 80 and above 90 respectively. Where in the 21st hour it reaches the least amount of less than 5 counts. Most of the frequencies are in the range of 10 and 35.\nLooking at the minutes it is very spread out. Focusing on special occasions only four minutes which are 59th, 46th, 12th and 0th have counts more than 20. While 51st minute has a count of 2. Rather than this nothing more significant occurs here. I think considering these counts in perspective of specific operating systems is tedious amount of work and waste of time.\n\rDownload Size and IP ID\rPackages were downloaded but none of their names were given in this data-set. Therefore we cannot know which package were downloaded. Yet we can identify the package sizes which were downloaded most. According to the table an R package with 82375220 bytes has most downloads of 50, while second place goes to to a size of 82375219 bytes and finally in third place is for 82375216 bytes with 39 counts.\n\r\rSize\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\r82877772\r\r18\r\r\r\r78171328\r\r22\r\r\r\r82375216\r\r39\r\r\r\r82375219\r\r48\r\r\r\r82375220\r\r50\r\r\r\r\rLooking at the IP ID it is clear that 334 has the highest downloads of 55, while second place goes to 1060 with 46 downloads. Finally, ID number 1286 has 16 downloads with third place.\n\r\rIP ID\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\r623\r\r9\r\r\r\r157\r\r12\r\r\r\r1286\r\r16\r\r\r\r1060\r\r46\r\r\r\r334\r\r55\r\r\r\r\r\rConclusion\rI shall conclude my findings in point form\n\rMost of Sri lankans (93.58%) use windows as a OS for R downloads\n\rTop three R versions are 3.5.1, 3.4.3 and 3.5.0 with percentages respectively 36.52% 27.96% and 15.98%.\n\rWindows users use versions 3.5.1, 3.4.3 and 3.5.0 with percentages 34.56%, 26.53% and 3.5.0.\n\rMost of the downloads occur in the months October and December, while days are 10th and 11th, while hours are 3rd and 4th and minutes of 59th, 46th, 12th and 0th.\n\rDownload size of 82375220 bytes happens with the highest count of 50, while the IP ID of 334 has most downloads of 55.\n\r\r\rFurther Analysis\r\rWe can do similar analysis for other countries and compare them.\n\rUsing Size it should be possible to understand what is being downloaded.\n\r\rPlease see that\nThis is my Second post on the internet so please be kind to tolerate my mistakes in grammar and spellings.

Even though the title of data says Movie profit I am going to focus on the movies which did not generate any revenue domestic and suggest on gross in worldwide.\nThe packages that I have used here are magrittr, tidyverse, scales, ggthemr, knitr, kableExtra, ggthemr and lubridate. The theme I am using for plots is “flat dark”.\n\rUnderstand Genre and Mpaa Rating on Movies\r3401 movies with 8 variables of information which include numeric and categorical. There are 202 distributors for movies of four types of ratings which are G, PG, PG-13 and R, but 137 movies have no record of them. Also there are five categories for genre, where Drama with 1236, while horror with 298 movies.\nThere are five types of ratings but around half of them are R rated, while 1094 are PG-13. While 573 are in category of PG and G rated movies are only 85. Finally, 137 movies do not have any ratings.\nComedy movies are mostly R rated(under 17 requires guardian) and PG-13 (some material is inappropriate to under 13). Where the frequencies are respectively 367 and 328. 309 movies of adventure genre could be watched by children with accompanying parents and 67 movies can be watched by all ages.\nYet 645 Drama movies are R-rated.There is only one action movie for general audiences(for all) and obviously no horror film should be watched by children alone, yet there are 7 movies which you can watch with your parents.\nContengency table in counts for Genre versus MPAA Rating\r\r\r\r\rAction\r\rAdventure\r\rComedy\r\rDrama\r\rHorror\r\r\r\r\r\rG\r\r1\r\r67\r\r6\r\r11\r\r0\r\r\r\rPG\r\r34\r\r309\r\r79\r\r144\r\r7\r\r\r\rPG-13\r\r225\r\r83\r\r328\r\r398\r\r58\r\r\r\rR\r\r286\r\r14\r\r367\r\r645\r\r202\r\r\r\r\rWe think horror movies are mostly R-rated then it is true. But only it is explainable by percentage. Yet considering the amount of horror movies made generally it is very low even in this random sample. Action and Comedy movies have very close percentages for PG-13 ratedness, while 52% are R rated for Action and 47% are comedy.\nPercentage table for Genre versus MPAA Rating\r\r\r\r\rAction\r\rAdventure\r\rComedy\r\rDrama\r\rHorror\r\r\r\r\r\rG\r\r0.00\r\r0.14\r\r0.01\r\r0.01\r\r0.00\r\r\r\rPG\r\r0.06\r\r0.65\r\r0.10\r\r0.12\r\r0.03\r\r\r\rPG-13\r\r0.41\r\r0.18\r\r0.42\r\r0.33\r\r0.22\r\r\r\rR\r\r0.52\r\r0.03\r\r0.47\r\r0.54\r\r0.76\r\r\r\r\rThis data-set contains the release dates from 1956 to 2019. Even though it is not 2019 there is a movie which has been listed here. This explains the domestic and worldwide gross being zero as zero. Then again we have to be careful because there are movies which might not make profit at all, domestic or other wise.\n\rLets Focus of movies which has zero domestic gross\rNo revenue from 66 movies, that is interesting. So obviously Aqua man has a whopping more than 150 million dollars\nproduction budget and no profit because it was not released yet when this data set was compiled. Second rank is for “Wonder park” with 100 million dollars. This movie will be released in 2019.\n\rZero Domestic gross Point of View\rSurprisingly there are movies without any production budget information because I am very sure No movie is done for free. Specially it is odd to see “12 Angry Men” in this list, which leads to the conclusion not all Movies in this list are to be on-it in the first place. We have 66 movies to consider.\n\rGenre and MPAA Rating Point of View\rSo movies with R ratedness have the most count and they are also action and drama genre movies of count 10. Here also there are 11 movies with have not been classified into any rating. Finally, there is no G rated movie in this graphical representation. Majority of movies (31) are from R rated in related to rating. While considering genre the Drama category is represented by 24. Action, Drama and Horror movies includes missing rating.\n\rFinding Outliers in Perspective of Genre and MPAA Rating\rConsidering the box-plot there are 3 outliers in Drama while plotting data in perspective of genre. Most amount of production budget is concluded in Action genre, while the least is in Horror.\nIf we focus on the production budget with genre there are 7 outliers and one action movie has spent 100 million dollars, similarly a movie from adventure category spent more than 100 million dollars. Others production budget is way less than 50 million dollars.\nLeast amount budget is spent on movies of no rating mentioned while most is on PG-13 rated movies and it has one strong outlier. Previously with genre we had 7 outliers but according to MPAA rating there are only 6 outliers.\n\rProduction Budget and Worldwide Gross\rAccording to the ascending order in the list of 10 movies with lowest production budget only 2 have profited. One movie (All the Boys Love Mandy Lane) has considerably done good, but if you consider this list of 10 movies we have 12 angry men as well.\nFirst ten Least production budget movies while Domestic gross is zero\r\r\rMovie Name\r\rProduction Budget\r\rWordlwide Gross\r\rDistributor\r\rMPAA Rating\r\rGenre\r\r\r\r\r\r12 Angry Men\r\r340000\r\r0\r\rUnited Artists\r\rNA\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rMy Beautiful Laundrette\r\r400000\r\r0\r\rOrion Classics\r\rNA\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rEverything Put Together\r\r500000\r\r7890\r\rNA\r\rR\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rAll the Boys Love Mandy Lane\r\r750000\r\r1960521\r\rRadius\r\rR\r\rHorror\r\r\r\rJimmy and Judy\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rOutrider Pictures\r\rR\r\rAction\r\r\r\rThe Poker House\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rPhase 4 Films\r\rR\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rProud\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rCastle Hill Product…\r\rPG\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rSteppin: The Movie\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rWeinstein Co.\r\rPG-13\r\rComedy\r\r\r\rZombies of Mass Destruction\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rAfter Dark\r\rR\r\rComedy\r\r\r\rGrand Theft Parsons\r\r1200000\r\r0\r\rSwipe Films\r\rPG-13\r\rDrama\r\r\r\r\rThis indicates that we didn’t have records how much of profit in home and away properly, because there is no way that people did not watch that movie and not make any gross. So we conclude that some movies which were released before 1970s did not pertain any information of gross domestic or worldwide.\n\rYears, Months and Days versus Production Budget\rThere are 4 Movies before 1972 with zero for domestic gross which can conclude loss of information. Oddly in year 2014 there are 8 movies with zero domestic gross and most of the movies are after year 2000.\nConsidering the months there is no specialty most of the counts are in-between 3 and 8. In January there are only two movies.\nOnly the movies with release dates 19th and 25th have no domestic gross, while highest count of 6 occurs on 21st. Most of the days have the count of 1 movie.\n\rConclusion\rMy conclusion of the above plots and tables in point form\n\rIn the complete data set Drama Genre has most (1236) counts and least (298) count goes to Horror. While, most (1514) of the Movies are R rated, least count goes to Grated movies. Considering Genre and Rating, it is true that Horror movies are R rated while it represents 76%, and should not let children watch alone.\n\rWhile there are movies with No domestic gross some have not been released yet (Aqua man and Wonder Park). Further, some Movies do not even have worldwide gross. This causes missing information. Even though a famous movies such as “12 Angry Men”.\n\rThis missing information could be the related to the fact that there are 4 movies which were released before 1972. Oddly in 2014 there are 8 movies which do not contain domestic gross information. Further, most of these movies were released after year 2000.\n\rBox plot indicates Adventure genre have spent more range in production budget, while in perspective of MPAA rating PG-13 movies have most range in production budget with a clear outlier.\n\r\r\rFurther Analysis\r\rSimilarly we can focus on movies of world wide gross equals to zero with other variables.\n\rConduct scrutinized interest with movies of world wide gross zero and domestic gross zero.\n\r\rPlease see that This is my first post on the internet so please be kind to tolerate my mistakes in grammar and spellings. I intend to post more statistics related materials in the future and learn accordingly.
