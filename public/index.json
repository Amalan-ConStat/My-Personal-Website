Modeling such data relative to Binomial Mixture Distributions were discussed because Binomial distribution fails to model the data. The reason is actual observed variance of the data is greater than the assumed theoretical variance, which is defined as over dispersion. fitODBOD package has two versions until October 2018, but in the future there will be updates regularly each year. Whenever there are new distributions to model BOD the new versions will include these distributions. Further, if there are new techniques to make these distributions more useful they will be also added as functions. Version 1.1.0 was published in February 2018 and Version 1.20 was released in September 2018 with two new distributions.","tags":["package","R","CRAN","fitODBOD"],"title":"CRAN-fitODBOD: fitting Over Dispersed Binomial Outcome Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.
