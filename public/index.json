Even though the title of data says Movie profit I am going to focus on the movies which did not generate any revenue domestic and suggest on gross in worldwide.\nUnderstand Genre and Mpaa Rating on Movies\r3401 movies with 8 variables of information which include numeric and categorical. There are 202 distributors for movies of four types of ratings which are G, PG, PG-13 and R, but 137 movies have no record of them. Also there are five categories for genre, where Drama with 1236, while horror with 298 movies.\nThere are five types of ratings but around half of them are R rated, while 1094 are PG-13. While 573 are in category of PG and G rated movies are only 85. Finally, 137 movies do not have any ratings.\nComedy movies are mostly R rated(under 17 requires guardian) and PG-13 (some material is inappropriate to under 13). Where the frequencies are respectively 367 and 328. 309 movies of adventure genre could be watched by children with accompanying parents and 67 movies can be watched by all ages.\nYet 645 Drama movies are R-rated.There is only one action movie for general audiences(for all) and obviously no horror film should be watched by children alone, yet there are 7 movies which you can watch with your parents.\n\r\r\r\rAction\r\rAdventure\r\rComedy\r\rDrama\r\rHorror\r\r\r\r\r\rG\r\r1\r\r67\r\r6\r\r11\r\r0\r\r\r\rPG\r\r34\r\r309\r\r79\r\r144\r\r7\r\r\r\rPG-13\r\r225\r\r83\r\r328\r\r398\r\r58\r\r\r\rR\r\r286\r\r14\r\r367\r\r645\r\r202\r\r\r\r\rWe think horror movies are mostly R-rated then it is true. But only it is explainable by percentage. Yet considering the amount of horror movies made generally it is very low even in this random sample. Action and Comedy movies have very close percentages for PG-13 ratedness, while 52% are R rated for Action and 47% are comedy.\n\r\r\r\rAction\r\rAdventure\r\rComedy\r\rDrama\r\rHorror\r\r\r\r\r\rG\r\r0.00\r\r0.14\r\r0.01\r\r0.01\r\r0.00\r\r\r\rPG\r\r0.06\r\r0.65\r\r0.10\r\r0.12\r\r0.03\r\r\r\rPG-13\r\r0.41\r\r0.18\r\r0.42\r\r0.33\r\r0.22\r\r\r\rR\r\r0.52\r\r0.03\r\r0.47\r\r0.54\r\r0.76\r\r\r\r\rThis data-set contains the release dates from 1956 to 2019. Even though it is not 2019 there is a movie which has been listed here. This explains the domestic and worldwide gross being zero as zero. Then again we have to be careful because there are movies which might not make profit at all, domestic or other wise.\n\r\rLets Focus of movies which has zero domestic gross\rNo revenue from 66 movies, that is interesting. So obviously Aqua man has a whopping more than 150 million dollars\nproduction budget and no profit because it was not released yet when this data set was compiled. Second rank is for “Wonder park” with 100 million dollars. This movie will be released in 2019.\nZero Domestic gross Point of View\rSurprisingly there are movies without any production budget information because I am very sure No movie is done for free. Specially it is odd to see “12 Angry Men” in this list, which leads to the conclusion not all Movies in this list are to be on-it in the first place. We have 66 movies to consider.\n\rGenre and MPAA Rating Point of View\rSo movies with R ratedness have the most count and they are also action and drama genre movies of count 10. Here also there are 11 movies with have not been classified into any rating. Finally, there is no G rated movie in this graphical representation. Majority of movies (31) are from R rated in related to rating. While considering genre the Drama category is represented by 24. Action, Drama and Horror movies includes missing rating.\n\rFinding Outliers in Perspective of Genre and MPAA Rating\rConsidering the box-plot there are 3 outliers in Drama while plotting data in perspective of genre. Most amount of production budget is concluded in Action genre, while the least is in Horror.\nIf we focus on the production budget with genre there are 7 outliers and one action movie has spent 100 million dollars, similarly a movie from adventure category spent more than 100 million dollars. Others production budget is way less than 50 million dollars.\nLeast amount budget is spent on movies of no rating mentioned while most is on PG-13 rated movies and it has one strong outlier. Previously with genre we had 7 outliers but according to MPAA rating there are only 6 outliers.\n\rProduction Budget and Worldwide Gross\rAccording to the ascending order in the list of 10 movies with lowest production budget only 2 have profited. One movie (All the Boys Love Mandy Lane) has considerably done good, but if you consider this list of 10 movies we have 12 angry men as well.\n\r\rMovie Name\r\rProduction Budget\r\rWordlwide Gross\r\rDistributor\r\rMPAA Rating\r\rGenre\r\r\r\r\r\r12 Angry Men\r\r340000\r\r0\r\rUnited Artists\r\rNA\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rMy Beautiful Laundrette\r\r400000\r\r0\r\rOrion Classics\r\rNA\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rEverything Put Together\r\r500000\r\r7890\r\rNA\r\rR\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rAll the Boys Love Mandy Lane\r\r750000\r\r1960521\r\rRadius\r\rR\r\rHorror\r\r\r\rJimmy and Judy\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rOutrider Pictures\r\rR\r\rAction\r\r\r\rThe Poker House\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rPhase 4 Films\r\rR\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rProud\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rCastle Hill Product…\r\rPG\r\rDrama\r\r\r\rSteppin: The Movie\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rWeinstein Co.\r\rPG-13\r\rComedy\r\r\r\rZombies of Mass Destruction\r\r1000000\r\r0\r\rAfter Dark\r\rR\r\rComedy\r\r\r\rGrand Theft Parsons\r\r1200000\r\r0\r\rSwipe Films\r\rPG-13\r\rDrama\r\r\r\r\rThis indicates that we didn’t have records how much of profit in home and away properly, because there is no way that people did not watch that movie and not make any gross. So we conclude that some movies which were released before 1970s did not pertain any information of gross domestic or worldwide.\n\rYears, Months and Days versus Production Budget\rThere are 4 Movies before 1972 with zero for domestic gross which can conclude loss of information. Oddly in year 2014 there are 8 movies with zero domestic gross and most of the movies are after year 2000.\nConsidering the months there is no specialty most of the counts are in-between 3 and 8. In January there are only two movies.\nOnly the movies with release dates 19th and 25th have no domestic gross, while highest count of 6 occurs on 21st. Most of the days have the count of 1 movie.\n\r\rConclusion\r\rIn the complete data set Drama Genre has most (1236) counts and least (298) count goes to Horror. While, most (1514) of the Movies are R rated, least count goes to Grated movies. Considering Genre and Rating, it is true that Horror movies are R rated while it represents 76%, and should not let children watch alone.\n\rWhile there are movies with No domestic gross some have not been released yet (Aqua man and Wonder Park). Further, some Movies do not even have worldwide gross. This causes missing information. Even though a famous movies such as “12 Angry Men”.\n\rThis missing information could be the related to the fact that there are 4 movies which were released before 1972. Oddly in 2014 there are 8 movies which do not contain domestic gross information. Further, most of these movies were released after year 2000.\n\rBox plot indicates Adventure genre have spent more range in production budget, while in perspective of MPAA rating PG-13 movies have most range in production budget with a clear outlier.\n\r\r\rFurther Analysis\r\rSimilarly we can focus on movies of world wide gross equals to zero with other variables.\n\rConduct scrutinized interest with movies of world wide gross zero and domestic gross zero.\n\r\r\r","date":1542153600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542153600,"objectID":"ecbe15e4570ea80c140b0b32dee79344","permalink":"/post/week_30/week-30-movie-profit/","publishdate":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/week_30/week-30-movie-profit/","section":"post","summary":"Movie Profit, Not So Profit\r\rIntroduction\rThis is my second post on Tidy Tuesday and the data-set in question is Movie profit data-set.

Datasets are uploaded every tuesday, and plots are published under the #tidytuesday. This is just me presenting a few accumulated plots for the dataset r-downloads.csv and r_downloads_year.csv.\nI shall be focusing on the data set provided on 2018 October 30th, Which is R and Package download stats My main objective is to understand how Sri Lankan users have behaved in in this dataset.\nThe packages used in R are ggplot2, lubridate, ggthemr, gridExtra, magrittr, knitr and kableExtra.\nThere are 701 downloads occured in between the given time limit of 2017 october 20th to 2018 october 20th in Sri Lanka. Similarly, if we look at the downloads on the day of 2018 October 23rd, which is 3. There are 7 variables to be concerend, which are\n\rdate - date of download (y-m-d)\rtime - time of download (in UTC)\rsize - size in bytes\rversion - R release version\ros - Operating System\rcountry - Two letter ISO country code\rip_id - Anonymized dialy ip code(unique identifier)\r\r\rOperating Systems\rWindows is not a favourable operating system for open source programming was my myth. Well, No longer I shall believe that if it is considering Sri Lankans and R programming.\n\r\rOperating System\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\rosx\r\r0.0371\r\r\r\rsrc\r\r0.0271\r\r\r\rwin\r\r0.9358\r\r\r\r\rMajority of users have used Windows which is 93.58%, while Mac users are represented with 3.71% and finally 2.71% from the source file. Next, focusing on the R versions downloaded.\n\rR versions\rVersions are updated regularly for R and a grand update occured on 2018 April for the version 3.5.0. Further, versions 3.4.3 and 3.4.4 were updated in the time gap considered. There are versions from 3.0.0 and higher for Sri Lankans. It is crucial to study this where we can understand how far does the user have knowledge about R and updating the version.\nTable shows that version 3.5.1 represents a 36.52% followed by version 3.4.3 of 27.96% and in the third place version 3.5.0 with 15.98%. Further, all downloads are occured for versions 3.0.0 or higher than it. People believed in 3.4.3 than 3.5.0, which could only mean that 3.4.3 was more stable for users requirements.\n\r\rR Version\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\r3.0.0\r\r0.0014\r\r\r\r3.2.2\r\r0.0014\r\r\r\r3.4.0\r\r0.0014\r\r\r\r3.3.3\r\r0.0029\r\r\r\r3.4.1\r\r0.0029\r\r\r\r3.4.4\r\r0.0899\r\r\r\r3.4.2\r\r0.0956\r\r\r\r3.5.0\r\r0.1598\r\r\r\r3.4.3\r\r0.2796\r\r\r\r3.5.1\r\r0.3652\r\r\r\r\rIf we further divide the operating systems bar plot with respective to R version it is clearly seen that only versions 3.5.1, 3.5.0, 3.4.4, 3.4.3 and 3.4.2 have maintained importance for the windows operating system.\nContingency table for R version vs Operating System\r\r\r\r\r3.0.0\r\r3.2.2\r\r3.3.3\r\r3.4.0\r\r3.4.1\r\r3.4.2\r\r3.4.3\r\r3.4.4\r\r3.5.0\r\r3.5.1\r\r\r\r\r\rosx\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0029\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0100\r\r0.0086\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0071\r\r0.0086\r\r\r\rsrc\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0029\r\r0.0043\r\r0.0057\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0100\r\r\r\rwin\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0813\r\r0.2653\r\r0.0899\r\r0.1512\r\r0.3466\r\r\r\r\rWindows operating percentages indicate that 34.66% of users have choosen version 3.5.1, 26.53% have choosen version 3.4.3 and finally version 3.5.0 with 15.12%. Close to 9% is represented by version 3.4.2 and 3.4.4.\n\rDate versus Operating System\rDate is a difficult variable in statistics therefore I have dissemininated the date into 4 types, which are month(January to December), day(1-31), hour(0-23) and minutes(0-59). Further, I have tried to understand what type of operating systems were used in the time perspective.\nSo, the first sub part of time is months. Here, we are considering 12 months of an year and months August and April reflects a no OS better than Windows property. While, August holding the least amount of downloads with slightly above frequency 20. Highest percentage occurs to October with count higher than 130 and significantly osx and src types of files also have higher amount than anyother month. Except this only the month of december has counts higher than 100.\nNext, focusing on the days it is clear that 10th and 11th have most downloads respectively reaching more than 60 and 70 in counts, while in other days it mostly less than 30%. Further, clearly on the 31st it includes less than frequency of 10 because 31st is not a part of all 12 months. It would be very tiring to focus on operating systems individually, but to be fair there is clear sign of few days with only the use of windows, and a few days with combination of other operating systems with windows.\nI have been curious at this part because of wanting to know at which hour of the day did our Sri Lankan users download R. Yet it should be noted that the hour of time could be local time of Sri Lanka or otherwise. Still according to the bar chart the hours 4 and 5 have most downloads with counts of above 80 and above 90 respectively. where in the 21st hour it reaches a very low amount of less than 5 counts. Most of the frequencies are in the range of 10 and 50.\nLooking at the minutes it is very spread out. Focusing on special occasions only four minutes which are 59, 46, 12 and 0 have counts more than 20. While 51st minute has a count of 2. Rather than this nothing more significant occurs here. I think considering these counts in perspective of specific operating systems is tedious amount of work and waste of time.\n\rDownload Size and IP ID\rPackages were downloaded but none of their names were given in this dataset. Therefore we cannot know which package was downloaded. Yet we can identify the package sizes which were downloaded most. According to the table an R package with 82375220 bytes has most downloaded of 50, while second place goest to a size of 82375219 bytes and finally in third place is for 82375216 bytes with 39 counts.\n\r\rSize\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\r82877772\r\r18\r\r\r\r78171328\r\r22\r\r\r\r82375216\r\r39\r\r\r\r82375219\r\r48\r\r\r\r82375220\r\r50\r\r\r\r\rLooking at the IP ID it is clear that 334 has the highest downloads of 55, while second place goes to 1060 with 46 downloads. Finally, ID nunber 1286 has 16 downloads with third place.\n\r\rIP ID\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\r623\r\r9\r\r\r\r157\r\r12\r\r\r\r1286\r\r16\r\r\r\r1060\r\r46\r\r\r\r334\r\r55\r\r\r\r\r\rConclusion\rI shall conclude my findings in point form\n\rMost of Sri lankans (93.58%) use windows as a OS for R downloads\n\rTop three R versions are 3.5.1, 3.4.3 and 3.5.0 with percentages respectively 36.52% 27.96% and 15.98%.\n\rWindows users use versions 3.5.1, 3.4.3 and 3.5.0 with percentages 34.56%, 26.53% and 3.5.0.\n\rMost of the downloads occur in the months October and December, while days are 10th and 11th, while hours are 3rd and 4th and minutes of 59th, 46th, 12th and 0th.\n\rDownload size of 82375220 bytes happens with the highest count of 50, while the IP ID of 334 has most downloads of 55.\n\r\rPlease see that This is my first post on the internet so please be kind to tolerate my mistakes in grammar and spellings.

The reason is actual observed variance of the data is greater than the assumed theoretical variance, which is defined as over dispersion. fitODBOD package has two versions until October 2018, but in the future there will be updates regularly each year. Whenever there are new distributions to model BOD the new versions will include these distributions. Further, if there are new techniques to make these distributions more useful they will be also added as functions. Version 1.1.0 was published in February 2018 and Version 1.20 was released in September 2018 with two new distributions.","tags":["package","R","CRAN","fitODBOD"],"title":"CRAN-fitODBOD: fitting Over Dispersed Binomial Outcome Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.
