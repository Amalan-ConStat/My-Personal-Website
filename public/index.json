We will be using the technique of maximizing the Log Likelihood function or minimizing the Negative Log Likelihood function. Based on this technique we will compare these R functions because it might benefit people who are struggling to which one to choose. We have 7 functions in total by my knowledge when I was writing this post.\nUsing the fitODBOD package, I will use the Alcohol Consumption data to try and model it for the Beta Binomial Distribution, which has two shape parameters to estimate. The process is that we find values for shape parameters a and b (or \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\)) which will maximize the Log Likelihood function of Beta Binomial Distribution or in our case minimize the Negative Log Likelihood function of Beta Binomial Distribution.\nAbove mentioned Beta-Binomial distributions Probability Mass function is denoted as\n\\[P_{BetaBin}(x)= {n \\choose x} \\frac{B(\\alpha+x,n+\\beta-x)}{B(\\alpha,\\beta)} \\]\nwhere \\(n=0,1,2,...\\), \\(x=0,1,2,...,n\\) and \\(\\alpha,\\beta \u0026gt; 0\\). Further \\(x\\) is the Binomial Random variable, a,b(or \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\)) are shape parameters and \\(n\\) is the binomial trial value. Also B(\\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\beta\\)) is the beta function. In this distribution we have to estimate the values for a and b.\nFurther, using the PMF we can construct the Likelihood function for \\(\\Omega_{BB}=(\\alpha,\\beta)^T\\) as given below:\n\\[L(\\Omega_{BB}|x)=\\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\binom{n}{x_i} \\frac{B(\\alpha+x_i,n+\\beta-x_i)}{B(\\alpha,\\beta)}\\]\nwhere N is the Number of observations. Then Negative Log Likelihood function is given as\n\\[l(\\Omega_{BB}|x)=-\\sum_{i=1}^{N} log\\binom{n}{x_i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} log(B(\\alpha+x_i,n+\\beta-x_i)) - Nlog(B(\\alpha,\\beta))\\]\nIn the package fitODBOD we have the function EstMLEBetaBin which is constructed based on the above Negative Log Likelihood function and we will use it.\nWe take Log to transform the Likelihood function values into small values, which will simplify the computation process and save time. The estimation functions we need to compare will use specific mathematical methods to find the most appropriate shape parameter values.\nThe functions in question are\noptim\rnlm\rnlminb\rucminf\rmaxLik\rmle\rmle2\r\rFurther, I will focus on the attributes of the above functions considering from which package, Inputs, Outputs, Time to complete estimation and Analytical Methods used with the assistance of tables. Alcohol Consumption data has two sets of frequency values but only values from week 1 will be used. Below is the the Alcohol Consumption data, where number of observations is 399 and the Binomial Random variable is a vector of values from zero to seven.\nlibrary(fitODBOD)\rkable(Alcohol_data,\u0026quot;html\u0026quot;,align=c(\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;)) %\u0026gt;%\rkable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\u0026quot;striped\u0026quot;),font_size = 14,full_width = F) %\u0026gt;%\rrow_spec(0,color = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\rcolumn_spec(1,color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;)\r\r\rDays\r\rweek1\r\rweek2\r\r\r\r\r\r0\r\r47\r\r42\r\r\r\r1\r\r54\r\r47\r\r\r\r2\r\r43\r\r54\r\r\r\r3\r\r40\r\r40\r\r\r\r4\r\r40\r\r49\r\r\r\r5\r\r41\r\r40\r\r\r\r6\r\r39\r\r43\r\r\r\r7\r\r95\r\r84\r\r\r\r\roptim Function\roptim is the first function in concern. Documentation of the optim function is useful and it indicates that this function is only used on one input situations only. This means our EstMLEBetaBin function has to be modified. Reason for this is that only the parameters that should be estimated need to be input values but our EstMLEBetaBin function has four parameters which are a,b,x(Binomial Random Variable) and freq(corresponding frequency values).\nWhile using optim function first index refers to \\(\\alpha\\) or a and second index refers to \\(\\beta\\) or b. Further, we have to input the observations or in our case the Binomial random variable values and their respective frequencies. I think it is inconvenient to modify the EstMLEBetaBin function, because if we want to estimate parameters for different data-sets it would become extra work. After modification we have a new function which is foroptim and I can use it for demonstration and comparison.\nBelow is the code to estimation and going through the outputs. It should be noted that we have to provide initial parameter values as an input to the optim function and it is best to provide values in the domain of\nvalues a and b.\nHere the shape parameters a and b are in the region of greater than zero but less than positive infinity. So for the initial parameters of a=0.1 and b=0.2 we are finding parameters which would minimize the Negative Log Likelihood function of Beta-Binomial distribution.\n# new function to facilitate optim criteria\r# only one input but has two elements\rforoptim\u0026lt;-function(a)\r{\rEstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days, freq=Alcohol_data$week1,a=a[1],b=a[2])\r}\r# optimizing values for a,b using default inputs\roptim_answer\u0026lt;-optim(par=c(0.1,0.2),fn=foroptim)\r# obtaining class of output\rclass(optim_answer)\r#length of output\rlength(optim_answer)\r# the outputs\roptim_answer$par # estimated values for a, b\roptim_answer$value # minimized function value optim_answer$counts # see the documentation to understand\roptim_answer$convergence # indicates successful completion\roptim_answer$message # additional information\r# fitting the Beta-Binomial distribution with estimated shape parameter values\rfitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,\roptim_answer$par[1],optim_answer$par[2])\rSo the foroptim function can be used as above and parameters are estimated for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) (or a, b) for the Alcohol Consumption data week 1. Further we have scrutinized the outputs.\n\rpackage : stats\rNo of Inputs: 7\rMinimum required Inputs : 2\rClass of output : list\rNo of outputs: 5\rNo of Analytical Methods : 6\rDefault Method : Nelder-Mead\r\r\rnlm Function\rnlm function is also similar to optim but only one analytical method will be used, which is a Newton-type Algorithm. Here also there need to be changes made to our EstMLEBetaBin function as previously. After making those changes we have called the new Negative Log-likelihood R function as fornlm. Then we can use the nlm function and estimate a and b which are the initial shape parameter values of 0.1 and 0.2 respectively. Documentation of nlm function is very useful to understand how it works.\nBelow is the code for using nlm function appropriately and fiddling with the results.\n#new function to facilitate nlm criteria\rfornlm\u0026lt;-function(a)\r{\rEstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days, freq=Alcohol_data$week1,a=a[1],a[2])\r}\r#optimizing values for a,b using default input\rnlm_answer\u0026lt;-nlm(f=fornlm,p=c(0.1,0.2))\r#obtaining class of output\rclass(nlm_answer)\r#length of output\rlength(nlm_answer)\r# the outputs\rnlm_answer$estimate # estimated values for a, b\rnlm_answer$minimum # minimized function value nlm_answer$gradient # gradient at the estimated minimum of given funciton\rnlm_answer$code # indicates successful completion\rnlm_answer$iterations # number of iterations performed\r# fitting the Beta-Binomial distribution with estimated shape parameter values\rfitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,\rnlm_answer$estimate[1],nlm_answer$estimate[2])\rSimilarly for the fornlm function we have estimated values for a and b which would fit the Alcohol consumption data. of week 1.\n\rpackage : stats\rNo of Inputs: 12\rMinimum required Inputs : 2\rClass of output : list\rNo of outputs: 5\rNo of Analytical Methods : 1\rDefault Method : Newton-type Algorithm\r\r\rnlminb Function\rnlminb is also similar and requires that EstMLEBetaBin function to be restructured as previous two situations. After this task we now have a function called fornlminb. nlminb function is based on analytical method of unconstrained and box-constrained optimization using PORT routines.\nAfter choosing initial parameter values for a and b, which are respectively 0.1 and 0.2 the estimation was done using nlminb function.\n# new function to facilitate nlminb criteria\rfornlminb\u0026lt;-function(a)\r{\rEstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days, freq=Alcohol_data$week1,a=a[1],a[2])\r}\r# optimizing values for a,b using default inputs\rnlminb_answer\u0026lt;-nlminb(start=c(0.1,0.2), objective=fornlminb)\r# obtaining class of output\rclass(nlminb_answer)\r# length of output\rlength(nlminb_answer)\r# the outputs\rnlminb_answer$par # estimated values for a, b\rnlminb_answer$objective # minimized function value nlminb_answer$evaluations # see the documentation to understand\rnlminb_answer$convergence # indicates successful completion\rnlminb_answer$message # additional information\rnlminb_answer$iterations # number of iterations performed\r# fitting the Beta-Binomial distribution with estimated shape parameter values\rfitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,\rnlminb_answer$par[1],nlminb_answer$par[2])\rDocumentation includes the information related to the function therefore referring it will be useful. After estimating values for a and b using nlminb function these were noticed as before in input and output criteria\n\rpackage : stats\rNo of Inputs: 8\rMinimum required Inputs : 2\rClass of output : list\rNo of outputs: 6\rNo of Analytical Methods : 1\rDefault Method : Unconstrained and box-constrained optimization using PORT routines\r\r\rucminf Function\rPackage uncminf produces the ucminf function, as previously mentioned functions here also we have to change the EstMLEBetaBin function. After making the changes we will be using the forucminf function to the estimation process of shape parameters a and b.\nWhen initial parameter values are set to a=0.1 and b=0.2 we will obtain results from ucminf function, which will minimize the Negative Log-likelihood function. Below is the code for estimation and using the results to understand the function ucminf.\nlibrary(ucminf)\r# new function to facilitate ucminf criteria\rforucminf\u0026lt;-function(a)\r{\rEstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days,freq = Alcohol_data$week1,a=a[1],a[2])\r}\r# optimizing values for a,b using default methods\rucminf_answer\u0026lt;-ucminf(par=c(0.1,0.2),fn=forucminf)\r#obtaining class\rclass(ucminf_answer)\r# length of output\rlength(ucminf_answer)\r# the outputs\rucminf_answer$par # estimated values for a, b\rucminf_answer$value # minimized function value ucminf_answer$invhessian.lt # see the documentation understand\rucminf_answer$convergence # indicates successful completion\rucminf_answer$message # additional information\rucminf_answer$info\r# fitting the Beta-Binomial distribution with estimated shape parameter values\rfitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,\rucminf_answer$par[1],ucminf_answer$par[2])\rWith the help of R Documentation the estimation was done for shape parameter values a and b using the ucminf function. Below are the initial understandings of the inputs and outputs of ucminf function\n\rpackage : ucminf\rNo of Inputs: 5\rMinimum required Inputs : 2\rClass of output : list\rNo of outputs: 6\rNo of Analytical Methods : 1\rDefault Method : Quasi-Newton Algorithm type with BFGS updating\r\r\rmaxLik Function\rmaxLik function is the cause of maxLik package, which only maximizes the Log Likelihood function. Therefore we have to restructure EstMLEBetaBin as previously mentioned but as an addition a negative sign is added for the output. This new function will be called as formaxLik.\nFor the initial parameter values where a=0.1 and b=0.2 the maxLik function will be used and results will be evaluated as below.\nlibrary(maxLik)\r# new function to facilitate maxLik criteria\rformaxLik\u0026lt;-function(a)\r{\r-EstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days,freq = Alcohol_data$week1,a=a[1],a[2])\r}\r# optimizing values for a,b using default methods\rmaxLik_answer\u0026lt;-maxLik(logLik =formaxLik, start = c(0.1,0.2))\r# obtaining class of output\rclass(maxLik_answer)\r# length of output\rlength(maxLik_answer)\r# the outputs\rmaxLik_answer$estimate # estimated values for a, b\rmaxLik_answer$maximum # minimized function value maxLik_answer$iterations # no of iterations to succeed\rmaxLik_answer$gradient # last gradient value which was calculated\rmaxLik_answer$message # additional information\rmaxLik_answer$hessian # hessian matrix\rmaxLik_answer$code # indicates successful completion\rmaxLik_answer$fixed # logical vector indicating which parameters are constants\rmaxLik_answer$type # type of maximization\rmaxLik_answer$last.step # list describing the last unsuccessful step\rmaxLik_answer$control # see the documentation understand\r# fitting the Beta-Binomial distribution with estimated shape parameter values\rfitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,\rmaxLik_answer$estimate[1],maxLik_answer$estimate[2])\rUsing the Documentation of maxLik and further using the Documentation of maxNR function.

Here also as previously we need to make some changes as below and create a new estimating function called formle.\nFor the initial parameter values of a=0.1 and b=0.2 the Negative Log Likelihood value has been minimized using mle function. Below is the code for estimation and investigation from the outputs of mle after estimation.\nlibrary(stats4)\r# new function to facilitate mle criteria\rformle\u0026lt;-function(a,b)\r{\rEstMLEBetaBin(x=Alcohol_data$Days,freq = Alcohol_data$week1,a,b)\r}\r# optimizing values for a,b using default methods\rmle_answer\u0026lt;-mle(minuslogl=formle,start = list(a=0.1,b=0.2))\r# obtaining class\rclass(mle_answer)\r# length of output\rlength(mle_answer)\r# the outputs\rmle_answer@call # inputs i have used mle_answer@coef # estimated values for a,b\rmle_answer@fullcoef # all values, even the fixed values we did not want to estimate\rmle_answer@vcov # variance covariance matrix for a,b\rmle_answer@min # minimized function value\rmle_answer@details # details after estimation process\rmle_answer@nobs # number of observations to be used for computing only if given mle_answer@method # optimization methods used\r# Methods used\rconfint(mle_answer) # confidence intervals for estimated values\rlogLik(mle_answer) # Negative loglikelihood value for estimated values profile(mle_answer) # Likelihood profile generation.\rnobs(mle_answer) # number of observations to be used for computing only if given\rshow(mle_answer) # display object briefly\rsummary(mle_answer) # generate a summary\r#update() # updating if we have new data and need to estimate new values\rvcov(mle_answer) # variance covariance matrix\r# fitting the Beta-Binomial distribution with estimated shape parameter values\rfitBetaBin(Alcohol_data$Days,Alcohol_data$week1,\rmle_answer@coef[1],mle_answer@coef[2])\rIt should be noted that in all 5 previous function we only saw lists of output, but through mle we are seeing a class of mle output.The Documention explains the inputs and outputs of mle.

Using this table we can choose the best suitable function for our needs of estimating parameters.\nI would prefer mle2 function than others because it provides special methods to handle the mle2 outputs and the output themselves are very thorough than other R functions. It can be seen that even though estimated a and b shape parameter values seem different only from the fourth decimal point in between all outputs.

In order to do this time comparison it is possible to use the benchmark function of rbenchmark package and below mentioned code chunk provides the output in a table form which includes the functions and their respective time values. The estimation process of the parameters where each function has been replicated 1000 times to receive a more accurate and strong table of time values.\nThe table is order according to the elapsed time value column in ascending order. According to this we can see that least time takes to the nlminb function and most time is taken to the mle2 function. These times complete depends on the Negative Log Likelihood function you need to minimize, the data you provided, the number of estimators that needs to be estimated and finally the complexity of the function.\nTherefore based on the needs of your output and the function which needs estimation choose the best function.

Further , my tweet is also in this hyperlink.\nData on bridges is of week 35 from TidyTuesday. Trying to explain the data using maps is obvious, yet I will use animated jitter plots. There are 13 variables and 2079 observations. Brave choice of limiting my self to less than 10 variables, where latitude, longitude and Vehicles will not be taken into account.\nSo with the help of packages tidyverse, ggthemr, gganimate,formattable and readr I will complete this analysis. Most of the bridges are owned by several agencies, but I will only focus on the top three ownership holders.\nCounties which have bridges owned by State Highway Agency\rClose to 1000 bridges are owned by State Highway Agency, where most of them are in Baltimore County. High amount of bridges are in good condition, further more bridges are in Fair condition and only around 10 bridges in Poor condition.\nConsidering the Average Daily Traffic only one bridge in Poor condition has the amount of close to 110,000, while all the other poor condition bridges have Average Daily Traffic less than 30,000. While counties Anne Arundel and Hartford have no Poor condition bridges at all.\nMost of the bridges are from Baltimore County and around 20 bridges have count of more than 150,000 Average Daily Traffic for both Fair and Good conditions. Hartford and Carroll Counties have their Average Daily Traffic which does not exceed 80,000 at any condition of the bridge.\n# jitter plot to State Highway Agency\rggplot(subset(bridges,Owner==\u0026quot;State Highway Agency\u0026quot;)\r,aes(color=Condition,y=`Average Daily Traffic`,x=str_wrap(County,7)))+\rxlab(\u0026quot;County\u0026quot;)+\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Condition of Bridges owned by State Highway Agency \\nand their Average Daily Traffic\u0026quot;)+\rscale_y_continuous(labels =seq(0,230000,10000) ,breaks = seq(0,230000,10000))+\rtransition_states(Condition,transition_length = 2,state_length = 3)+\renter_fade()+exit_shrink()+ease_aes(\u0026quot;back-in\u0026quot;)+geom_jitter()\r\rCounties which have bridges owned by County Highway Agency\rCounty Highway Agency owns the second most amount of bridges in this data-set. Therefore using jitter plots we are going to check how the condition of the bridges and counties are explained in the simplest manner.\nLess amount of poor condition bridges in all counties except Anne Roundel County. All bridges owned by County Highway Agency have a limited Average Daily Traffic less than 50,000. Clearly we have more Fair bridges than Good ones. In the Poor condition category only two have Average Daily Traffic more than 20,000, while other two have more than 10 bridges.\nMost of these bridges are in Baltimore County even it is in any one of three conditions. There are few bridges which have values more than 40,000 Average Daily Traffic and they are also in Baltimore County.\nThere are bridges which have Zero Average Daily Traffic. In all three Conditions only Hartford County has bridges which has Average Daily Traffic less than 10,000.\n# jitter plot to County Highway Agency\rggplot(subset(bridges,Owner==\u0026quot;County Highway Agency\u0026quot;)\r,aes(color=Condition,y=`Average Daily Traffic`,x=str_wrap(County,7)))+\rxlab(\u0026quot;County\u0026quot;)+ geom_jitter()+\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Condition of Bridges owned by County Highway Agency \\nand their Average Daily Traffic\u0026quot;)+\rscale_y_continuous(labels =seq(0,40000,5000) ,breaks = seq(0,40000,5000))+\rtransition_states(Condition,transition_length = 2,state_length = 3)+\renter_fade()+exit_shrink()+ease_aes(\u0026quot;back-in\u0026quot;)\r\rCounties which have bridges owned by State Toll Authority\rThere is only bridge which is in Poor condition and it is in Baltimore County, while counties Howard and Anne Arundel have no Good condition bridges. Further there is only 3 Fair condition bridges in Howard County while they have values for Average Daily Traffic less than 10,000.\nThe highest Average Daily Traffic is close to 170,000 which are only 4 and are in Good and Fair conditions. Further, Anne Arundel County has only one Good bridge and in Hartford it is six bridges. Only few of the bridges have Average Daily Traffic close to zero.\n# jitter plot to State tolll authority\rggplot(subset(bridges,Owner==\u0026quot;State Toll Authority\u0026quot;)\r,aes(color=Condition,y=`Average Daily Traffic`,x=str_wrap(County,7)))+\rxlab(\u0026quot;County\u0026quot;)+geom_jitter()+\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Condition of Bridges owned by State Toll Authority \\nand their Average Daily Traffic\u0026quot;)+\rscale_y_continuous(labels =seq(0,170000,10000) ,breaks = seq(0,170000,10000))+\rtransition_states(Condition,transition_length = 2,state_length = 3)+\renter_fade()+exit_shrink()+ease_aes(\u0026quot;back-in\u0026quot;)\r\rMost amount of bridges Built based on Year\rYears 1957, 1970, 1975, 1991, 1963 and 1961 have the top 6 spots for building more than 50 bridges in those years. If we consider the conditions of Fair and Good only the year 1991 is suitable to be mentioned, while all other years has at-least one Poor condition bridge. Further There are more Poor condition bridges in 1961 than in 1957. While all Poor condition bridges has Average Daily Traffic less than 50,000.\nFinally, there are only few bridges which have Average Daily Traffic above 100,000 and only 3 are in Good condition. There are Bridges which can have Average Daily Traffic close to zero in all 6 years and all conditions.\n# jitter plot to years based on Most amount of bridges built\rggplot(subset(bridges,`Year Built`==\u0026quot;1957\u0026quot; | `Year Built`==\u0026quot;1970\u0026quot; | `Year Built`==\u0026quot;1975\u0026quot; | `Year Built`==\u0026quot;1991\u0026quot; |\r`Year Built`==\u0026quot;1963\u0026quot; | `Year Built`==\u0026quot;1961\u0026quot;)\r,aes(color=Condition,y=`Average Daily Traffic`,x=factor(`Year Built`)))+\rxlab(\u0026quot;Year Built\u0026quot;)+ylab(\u0026quot;Average Daily Traffic\u0026quot;)+\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Most amount of Bridges built based on Years \\nand their Conditions\u0026quot;)+\rgeom_jitter()+legend_bottom()+\rtransition_states(Condition,transition_length = 2,state_length = 3)+\renter_fade()+exit_shrink()+ease_aes(\u0026quot;back-in\u0026quot;)\r\rAverage Traffic Less than or equal to 100,000 for Counties with Bridge Condition\rWhile obtaining summary for county variable there is one issue because there are two observations which say “Baltimore city” than “Baltimore City” and I don’t want to change them.\nIf we focus on Average Daily Traffic less than or equal to 100,000 based on County and Condition. It is clear that Poor condition bridges are part of this criteria and mostly Average Daily Traffic is less than 5000 for Counties Howard, Hartford and Carroll. While Baltimore County has highest amount up-to 75,000, but Baltimore County has highest amount close to 40,000 for Average Daily Traffic. Finally Anne Arundel County has only one Poor condition bridge which has Average Daily Traffic close to zero.\nWe can see that there are more Fair Condition bridges than Good ones. In Baltimore County most of the Fair condition bridges have Average Daily Traffic less than 15000. Similarly Carroll county and Hartford county also behave under such criteria. But for Good condition bridges this is not the case where there is no certain strong dense region as similar to Fair condition bridges.\nPreviously when we looked into county we did not see Baltimore City often as a factor, but here that is not the case.\n# jitter plot to average daily Traffic less than or equal 1000000\rggplot(subset(bridges,`Average Daily Traffic`\u0026lt;=100000 \u0026amp; County!=\u0026quot;Baltimore city\u0026quot;),\raes(x=County,y=`Average Daily Traffic`,color=Condition))+\rxlab(\u0026quot;County\u0026quot;)+ylab(\u0026quot;Averag Daily Traffic\u0026quot;)+\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Average Daily Traffic Less than 100,000 \\nFor Counties\u0026quot;)+\rscale_y_continuous(labels = seq(0,100000,5000),breaks = seq(0,100000,5000))+\rtheme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90))+coord_flip()+ geom_jitter()+\rtransition_states(Condition,transition_length = 2,state_length = 3)+\renter_fade()+exit_shrink()+ease_aes(\u0026quot;back-in\u0026quot;)\r\rAverage Traffic More than 100,000 for Counties with Bridge Condition\rThis Jitter plot is completely different than previous one, because there are no clear dense regions for any counties and conditions of the bridge. There is only one Poor condition bridge in Baltimore County where the Average Daily Traffic is close to 115,000. In Fair condition bridges also Baltimore County holds the most, while they are slightly dense in the region of 175,000 to 190,000. while for Howard County similar density occurs between 190,000 to 205,000. Bridges in Good condition have more higher values in Baltimore County than Anne Arundel County.\n# jitter plot to average daily Traffic more than 1000000\rggplot(subset(bridges, `Average Daily Traffic` \u0026gt; 100000 \u0026amp; County != \u0026quot;Baltimore city\u0026quot;),\raes(x=County,y=`Average Daily Traffic`,color=Condition))+\rxlab(\u0026quot;County\u0026quot;)+ylab(\u0026quot;Average Daily Traffic\u0026quot;)+\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Average Daily Traffic More than 100,000 \\nFor Counties\u0026quot;)+\rscale_y_continuous(labels=seq(100000,230000,5000),breaks=seq(100000,230000,5000))+\rcoord_flip()+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90))+\rgeom_jitter()+transition_states(Condition,transition_length = 2,state_length = 3)+\renter_fade()+exit_shrink()+ease_aes(\u0026quot;back-in\u0026quot;)\r\rImprovement and Bridge Conditions with Counties\rIn the variable of Total Improvement there are 1438 missing values, 42 values are zero and the rest are actual values. I am going to look at Total Improvement in two tables. First table will include where Bridges have Total Improvement higher than 9,999,000 and less than 30,000,000. Second table is for Bridges which have Total Improvement higher than or equal to 30,000,000.\nFurther to make these tables interesting I will be using the package formattable, and colors and tiles for numerical values. In the first table there are 7 bridges while only Anne Arundel County holds 3 and Baltimore City holds 4. One bridge is from 1953, and others are from the period of 1977 to 1983. Conditions of these bridges are mostly Fair and two bridges are in Good condition. Lowest Average Daily Traffic is 11760, while highest is 124193, where both bridges are in Fair Condition, and the amount spent on them for Total Improvement are respectively 18,163,000 and 16,264,000. The bridge with Highest amount of Average Daily traffic is built in 1953.\n# removing unnecessary columns and setting restriction to # Total Improvement\rTop10\u0026lt;-subset(bridges[,c(-1,-2,-9,-10,-11,-12,-13)], `Total Improvement` \u0026gt; 9999 \u0026amp; `Total Improvement` \u0026lt; 30000)\r# setting colours\rcustomRed0 = \u0026quot;#FF8080\u0026quot;\rcustomRed = \u0026quot;#7F0000\u0026quot;\rcustomyellow0 = \u0026quot;#FFFF80\u0026quot;\rcustomyellow = \u0026quot;#BFBF00\u0026quot;\rcustomblue0 = \u0026quot;#6060BF\u0026quot;\rcustomblue = \u0026quot;#00007F\u0026quot;\r# creating the table for above data set\rformattable(Top10,align=c(\u0026quot;l\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;l\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;),\rlist(\rCounty =formatter(\u0026quot;span\u0026quot;,style= ~style(color=\u0026quot;grey\u0026quot;)),\r`Total Improvement`=color_tile(customblue0,customblue),\r`Average Daily Traffic`=color_tile(customyellow0,customyellow),\r`Year Built`=color_tile(customRed0,customRed)\r))\r\r\rCounty\r\rCarries\r\rYear Built\r\rCondition\r\rAverage Daily Traffic\r\rTotal Improvement\r\r\r\r\r\rAnne Arundel County\r\rMD 2\r\r1983\r\rFair\r\r53221\r\r13504\r\r\r\rAnne Arundel County\r\rUS 50\r\r1953\r\rFair\r\r124193\r\r16264\r\r\r\rAnne Arundel County\r\rUPPER LEVEL ROADWA\r\r1977\r\rFair\r\r11760\r\r18163\r\r\r\rBaltimore City \r\rIS 95 SB\r\r1977\r\rFair\r\r94765\r\r15785\r\r\r\rBaltimore City \r\rIS 95 VIADUCT SB\r\r1980\r\rGood\r\r63650\r\r16051\r\r\r\rBaltimore City \r\rIS 95 VIADUCT NB\r\r1980\r\rFair\r\r52850\r\r20484\r\r\r\rBaltimore City \r\rIS 95 SB\r\r1980\r\rGood\r\r55621\r\r20484\r\r\r\r\rWhen I did try to plot the top ten bridges with most Total improvement values there was one issue, which is the distance between first two values and the next 8 values. Therefore I divided the table into two.\nIn this second table We can see there are two bridges which are from Baltimore City and are built in 1980 and 1971, but the amount spent on Total Improvement is 300,000,000 each. But their Average Daily Traffic is respectively 56280 and 30600.\nWhile we have another bridge from Baltimore City and built in 1907, but Total Improvement amount is 35,026,000. Here, the Average Daily Traffic is 3900.\n# removing unnecessary columns and setting restriction to # Total Improvement\rTop3\u0026lt;-subset(bridges[,c(-1,-2,-9,-10,-11,-12,-13)], `Total Improvement` \u0026gt;= 30000)\r# setting colours\rcustomRed0 = \u0026quot;#FF8080\u0026quot;\rcustomRed = \u0026quot;#7F0000\u0026quot;\rcustomyellow0 = \u0026quot;#FFFF80\u0026quot;\rcustomyellow = \u0026quot;#BFBF00\u0026quot;\rcustomblue0 = \u0026quot;#6060BF\u0026quot;\rcustomblue = \u0026quot;#00007F\u0026quot;\r# creating the table for above data set\rformattable(Top3,align=c(\u0026quot;l\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;l\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;),\rlist(\rCounty =formatter(\u0026quot;span\u0026quot;,style= ~style(color=\u0026quot;black\u0026quot;)),\r`Total Improvement`=color_tile(customblue0,customblue),\r`Average Daily Traffic`=color_tile(customyellow0,customyellow),\r`Year Built`=color_tile(customRed0,customRed)\r))\r\r\rCounty\r\rCarries\r\rYear Built\r\rCondition\r\rAverage Daily Traffic\r\rTotal Improvement\r\r\r\r\r\rBaltimore City\r\rUS 40 EDMONDSON AV\r\r1907\r\rPoor\r\r3900\r\r35026\r\r\r\rBaltimore City\r\rIS 95 VIADUCT SB\r\r1980\r\rFair\r\r56280\r\r300000\r\r\r\rBaltimore City\r\rEASTERN AVENUE\r\r1971\r\rFair\r\r30600\r\r300000\r\r\r\r\r\r\rConclusion\rMy conclusion of the above plots and tables in point form\n\rJitter plots and animation are useful in explaining one continuous variable with multiple categorical variables.\n\rSub-setting the data set and applying formattable package is useful to explain different continuous values with in a table.\n\r\r\rFurther Analysis\r\rSimilarly we can use mapping to point out the locations of the bridges and use animation to make it more clear.\r\rPlease see that\nThis is my fifth post on the internet so please be kind to tolerate my mistakes in grammar and spellings.

The data was acquired buy a survey conducted online and information about them are here.\nThis is my tweet on week 34\nPeople who do and do not celebrate Thanksgiving\rIn this ThanksGiving data set 980 are celebrating, and 78 are not celebrating Thanksgiving. I will use plots to understand their composition and tables to explain them further.\nVariables in consideration for this task is none other than Age, Gender, Family Income and US regions. Finally my aim is to create animated plots and interactive tables for the above variables through the help of packages gganimate and kable.\nAge Distribution\rFirst the age distribution has only 4 groups, where people who celebrate Thanksgiving in the age category of 18-29 is the very least. Highest count goes to the age category of 45-59 with 269. There are 33 missing observations and they were removed.\nConsidering the people who do not celebrate Thanksgiving the least count of 6 goes to category of 60+, but here the category of 18-29 has the highest count of 31. No missing observations were recorded here.\nBelow is an animated bar plot where the counts change for their respective 4 categories.

Some regions are having higher death rate close to 75, while others have lower death rate close to 0.0002.\nFirst group is the sub regions which are having higher death rates than other SDI regions, which are Low SDI and Low-middle SDI countries. Low SDI countries are behaving poorly from 1990 with a 73.78 death rate which reaches it highest peek of 75.88 in 2001 after this death rate gradually declines until 2016 and reaches 37.87.\nThis is not the case for Low middle SDI countries where in 1990 death rate is 19.11 and reaches its peek of 22.01 in 2003 with small fluctuations.

Therefore, first I did plot all 5 regions together and then sub setted them based on their death rate change in values.\nIt is clear that High SDI values have the lowest death rate and Low, Low middle SDI have the highest death rates over the years 1990 to 2016.\n\rSaharan Region with Malaria Death Count Rate\rThere are 5 sub parts for Saharan region countries, which are Central Sub-Saharan, Eastern Sub-Saharan, Southern Sub-Saharan, Western Sub-Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Here though it does not look like we need to separate these regions and plot them as groups. While plotting them as a whole they are clear and possible to interpret the differences in this line plot.\nCentral Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Sub-Saharan Africa countries behave similarly where they start with death rates respectively 108.67, 118.94. Further this death rate increases and reaches its highest peaks of 138.23 and 121.08 respectively for Western Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Sub-Saharan Africa countries for the year 2003. Finally they decrease into their lowest of 64.64 death rate for Central Sub-Saharan Africa and 87.54 death rate for Western Sub-Saharan Africa.\nSub-Saharan Africa Regions has a higher death rate performance through out the time line when it begins with 89.33 in 1990, and reaches its highest value of 96.28 in 2003. Further death rate decreases slowly up-to 51.93 in 2016, which is the least minimum value. Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa starts with 77.83 in 1990 and reaches its peak of 78.49 in 1991. In the next few years until 2000 there is small fluctuations. Finally there is a steep slope and reaches its lowest death rate value of 23.15 in 2016.\nDeath rate of Southern Sub-Saharan Africa is completely different than above four sub regions of Saharan Africa. In 1990 the death rate is 1.69 and it fluctuates until 2016, but it reaches the highest death rate of 2.57 in 2006.

At the beginning of 1990 the death rate gap between both these regions are clearly high.\n\rConclusion\rI shall conclude my findings in point form\n\rDeath rate for malaria decreases over the years with small fluctuations over the years and reaches zero in 2016 for Sri Lanka. By 2016 all age categories reach a death count of zero, but in 1990 they are at different parts of the scale.\n\rHigh SDI countries have a low death rate. While Low and Low middle SDI countries have the highest death rates over the years from 1990 to 2016.\n\rIn the Saharan region lowest death rate is for Southern Sub-Saharan region and highest death rate is for Western Sub-Saharan region on the year 2016. This order is same for year 1990 as well in these regions. Highest death rate of all years and all sub regions occurs in year 2003 of 138.23 for Western Sub-Saharan Africa. While lowest death rate of all years and all sub regions is in year 1994 for Southern Sub-Saharan Africa with 1.55.\n\rEuropean and Great Britain related regions have no malaria related incidents over the years of 1990 to 2016, this could be because of their cold climate pattern and their developed status in the world.\n\rNorth America shows figures of no malaria related deaths over the years of 1990 to 2016. Southern Latin America has the lowest death rate of 0.0035 in 2016 and highest death rate is for Central Latin America. But in year 1990 highest death rate is for Andean Latin American region which is 0.354 and least death rate is for Southern Latin America with 0.0208.\n\rAustralasia has no death rate over the years of 1990 to 2016. Where in year 2016 lowest death rate occurs to High Income Asia Pacific of 0.0008 and highest in that year for Oceania region with a value of 8.71. In the year 1990 highest death rate is for Oceania region with 14.78 but lowest is for High Income Asia Pacific region with 0.0073. A special occurrence where comparing all the regions and years the highest death rate is for Oceania Region in year 2000.\n\rHighest death rate occurs in year 2005 for North Africa and Middle East region, but in 1990 the malaria death rate is 0.7968. Further in 2011 it hits the lowest value of 0.731 and finally moves up-to 0.8332 in year 2016.\n\rIn year 1990 Caribbean region has a lower death rate than Latin American and Caribbean region. But this gap gradually decreases over time and by year 2016 Caribbean region reaches a death rate of 0.058 while Latin America and Caribbean region occupies the rate of 0.0468.\n\r\r\rFurther Analysis\r\rThis article only focuses on the death rate but we can expand it to countries and compare them over continents.\n\rIt is possible to consider the age category and compare the death counts of different regions to understand further of these regions.\n\r\rPlease see that\nThis is my third post on the internet so please be kind to tolerate my mistakes in grammar and spellings. I intend to post more statistics related materials in the future and learn accordingly.

Further, I have tried to understand what type of operating systems were used in those time types.\n#checking which months the downloads occured inrespecitive to operating system\rggthemr(\u0026quot;flat dark\u0026quot;)\rggplot(r_downloads_year_LK,aes(x=month(date),fill=os))+\rgeom_bar()+ xlab(\u0026quot;Months\u0026quot;) +ylab(\u0026quot;Frequency\u0026quot;)+\rscale_y_continuous(breaks =seq(0,140,10))+\rscale_x_continuous(breaks=1:12) +\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Operating systems used in the months of R download\u0026quot;,\rsubtitle = \u0026quot;2017 October 20th - 2018 October 20th\u0026quot;)\rSo, the first sub part of time is months. Here, we are considering 12 months of an year and months August and April reflects no Operating System is better than Windows property. While, August holding the least amount of downloads with slightly above frequency 20. Highest frequency occurs to October with count higher than 130 and significantly osx and src types of files also have higher amount than any-other month. Except August only the month of December has counts higher than 100.\n#checking which days the downloads occured inrespecitive to operating system\rggplot(r_downloads_year_LK,aes(x=day(date),fill=os))+\rgeom_bar()+xlab(\u0026quot;Days\u0026quot;) +ylab(\u0026quot;Frequency\u0026quot;)+\rscale_y_continuous(breaks =seq(0,80,10))+\rscale_x_continuous(breaks=1:31)+\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Operating systems used in the days of R download\u0026quot;,\rsubtitle = \u0026quot;2017 October 20th - 2018 October 20th\u0026quot;)\rNext, focusing on the days it is clear that 10th and 11th have most downloads respectively reaching more than 60 and 70 in counts, while in other days it is mostly less than 30. Further, clearly on the 31st it includes least frequency of 10 because 31st is not a common day of all 12 months. It would be very tiring to focus on operating systems individually, but to be fair there is clear sign of few days with only the use of windows, and a few days with combination of other operating systems with windows.\n#checking which hour the downloads occured inrespecitive to operating system\rggplot(r_downloads_year_LK,aes(x=hour(time),fill=os))+\rgeom_bar()+xlab(\u0026quot;Hour\u0026quot;) +ylab(\u0026quot;Frequency\u0026quot;)+\rscale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,100,5))+\rscale_x_continuous(breaks=0:23)+\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Operating systems used in the Hours of the day of R download\u0026quot;,\rsubtitle = \u0026quot;2017 October 20th - 2018 October 20th\u0026quot;)\rI have been curious at this part because of wanting to know at which hour of the day did our Sri Lankan users download R and packages. Yet it should be noted that the hour of time could be local time of Sri Lanka or otherwise. Still according to the bar chart the hours 4th and 5th have most downloads with counts of above 80 and above 90 respectively. Where in the 21st hour it reaches the least amount of less than 5 counts. Most of the frequencies are in the range of 10 and 35.\n#checking which minute the downloads occured inrespecitive to operating system\rggplot(r_downloads_year_LK,aes(x=minute(time),fill=os))+\rgeom_bar()+xlab(\u0026quot;Minute\u0026quot;) +ylab(\u0026quot;Frequency\u0026quot;)+\rscale_y_continuous(breaks = 0:25)+\rscale_x_continuous(breaks=0:59)+\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Operating systems used in the minutes of the day of R download\u0026quot;,\rsubtitle = \u0026quot;2017 October 20th - 2018 October 20th\u0026quot;)+\rcoord_flip()\rLooking at the minutes it is very spread out. Focusing on special occasions only four minutes which are 59th, 46th, 12th and 0th have counts more than 20. While 51st minute has a count of 2. Rather than this nothing more significant occurs here. I think considering these counts in perspective of specific operating systems is tedious amount of work and waste of time.\n\rDownload Size and IP ID\rPackages were downloaded but none of their names were given in this data-set. Therefore we cannot know which package were downloaded. Yet we can identify the package sizes which were downloaded most. According to the table an R package with 82375220 bytes has most downloads of 50, while second place goes to to a size of 82375219 bytes and finally in third place is for 82375216 bytes with 39 counts.\n# table of frequency for sizes of download\rtab3\u0026lt;-as.data.frame(sort(table(r_downloads_year_LK$size))%\u0026gt;% tail(5))\rnames(tab3)\u0026lt;-c(\u0026quot;Size\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Frequency\u0026quot;)\rkable(tab3) %\u0026gt;% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = \u0026quot;striped\u0026quot;, full_width = F,position=\u0026quot;left\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;%\radd_header_above(c(\u0026quot;Frequency table to Download size\u0026quot;=2))\r\r\rFrequency table to Download size\r\r\r\r\rSize\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\r82877772\r\r18\r\r\r\r78171328\r\r22\r\r\r\r82375216\r\r39\r\r\r\r82375219\r\r48\r\r\r\r82375220\r\r50\r\r\r\r\rLooking at the IP ID it is clear that 334 has the highest downloads of 55, while second place goes to 1060 with 46 downloads.

Even though it is not 2019 there is a movie which has been listed here. This explains the domestic and worldwide gross being zero as zero. Then again we have to be careful because there are movies which might not make profit at all, domestic or other wise.\n\rLets Focus of movies which has zero domestic gross\rNo revenue from 66 movies, that is interesting. So obviously Aqua man has a whopping more than 150 million dollars\nproduction budget and no profit because it was not released yet when this data set was compiled. Second rank is for “Wonder park” with 100 million dollars. This movie will be released in 2019.\n\rZero Domestic gross Point of View\rSurprisingly there are movies without any production budget information because I am very sure No movie is done for free. Specially it is odd to see “12 Angry Men” in this list, which leads to the conclusion not all Movies in this list are to be on-it in the first place. We have 66 movies to consider.\n# domestic gross zero only movies\rMovie_domestic_zero\u0026lt;-subset.data.frame(Movie,c(domestic_gross==0)) # checking dimensions\rdim(Movie_domestic_zero)\rattach(Movie_domestic_zero)\r# Scatterplot for production budget\rggplot(Movie_domestic_zero,aes(x=reorder(movie,production_budget),\ry=production_budget))+\rgeom_point()+theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+\rscale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format())+\rylab(\u0026quot;Production budget\u0026quot;)+xlab(\u0026quot;Movie names\u0026quot;)+\rggtitle(\u0026quot;Domestic Gross Zero but how production budget varies in Movies\u0026quot;)\r\rGenre and MPAA Rating Point of View\rSo movies with R ratedness have the most count and they are also action and drama genre movies of count 10. Here also there are 11 movies with have not been classified into any rating. Finally, there is no G rated movie in this graphical representation. Majority of movies (31) are from R rated in related to rating. While considering genre the Drama category is represented by 24.

So we conclude that some movies which were released before 1970s did not pertain any information of gross domestic or worldwide.\n\rYears, Months and Days versus Production Budget\rThere are 4 Movies before 1972 with zero for domestic gross which can conclude loss of information. Oddly in year 2014 there are 8 movies with zero domestic gross and most of the movies are after year 2000.\n# plotting years vs movies released\rggplot(Movie_domestic_zero,aes(x=year(release_date)))+\rgeom_bar()+ylab(\u0026quot;Frequency\u0026quot;)+xlab(\u0026quot;Years\u0026quot;)+\rscale_x_continuous(label=1956:2019,breaks=1956:2019)+\rscale_y_continuous(labels = 0:8,breaks = 0:8)+\rstat_count(aes(y=..count.., label=..count..), geom=\u0026quot;text\u0026quot;, vjust=-.5)+\rtheme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,hjust = 2))\rConsidering the months there is no specialty most of the counts are in-between 3 and 8.

While, most (1514) of the Movies are R rated, least count goes to Grated movies. Considering Genre and Rating, it is true that Horror movies are R rated while it represents 76%, and should not let children watch alone.\n\rWhile there are movies with No domestic gross some have not been released yet (Aqua man and Wonder Park). Further, some Movies do not even have worldwide gross. This causes missing information. Even though a famous movies such as “12 Angry Men”.\n\rThis missing information could be the related to the fact that there are 4 movies which were released before 1972. Oddly in 2014 there are 8 movies which do not contain domestic gross information. Further, most of these movies were released after year 2000.\n\rBox plot indicates Adventure genre have spent more range in production budget, while in perspective of MPAA rating PG-13 movies have most range in production budget with a clear outlier.\n\r\r\rFurther Analysis\r\rSimilarly we can focus on movies of world wide gross equals to zero with other variables.\n\rConduct scrutinized interest with movies of world wide gross zero and domestic gross zero.\n\r\rPlease see that This is my first post on the internet so please be kind to tolerate my mistakes in grammar and spellings.
