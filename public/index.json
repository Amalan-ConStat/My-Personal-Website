The frequencies are respectively 367 and 328.\rWhere 309 movies of adventure genre could be watched by children with accompanying parents and most(67) number of adventure movies can be watched by all ages. Yet 645 Drama movies are R-rated.\rWe think horror movies are mostly R-rated then it is true. But only is relative to percentage because considering the frequencies we make horror movies the least even according to this random sample.\rThis dataset contains the release dates from 1936 to 2019. Even though it is not 2019 there is a movie which has been listed here.\rThis explains the domestic and worldwide gross being zero as the minimum value of zero.

Majority of movies(31) from R rated\nand 24 of them are Drama genre.\n\rEven though no gross in domestic they have done quite done well around. There are 9 movies as outliers of this boxplot for genre. It should be noted that Drama category has the most significant outlier with 30 million where second outlier from action movie of close to 25 million dollars.\n\r\rIf we focus on the production budget with genre there are 7 outliers and one action movie has spent more than 1.5 billion dollars from the action genre while a movie from adventure category spent almost 1 billion USD. others are less than 50 milion USD. According to the descending order in the last 10 movies with lowest production budget only 2 have profitted. One movie (All the Boys Love Mandy Lane) has considereably done good, but if you consider this list of 10 movies we have 12 angry men as well. This indicates that we didn’t have records how much of profit in home and away, because there is no way that people didn’t watch that movie.So we conclude that some movies even though they aired earlier in the century did not has to be recorded for domestic and worldwide profit.\nMovie_worldwide_zero\u0026lt;-subset.data.frame(Movie,c(worldwide_gross==0))\rattach(Movie_worldwide_zero)\r## The following objects are masked from Movie_domestic_zero:\r## ## distributor, domestic_gross, genre, movie, mpaa_rating,\r## production_budget, release_date, worldwide_gross\r## The following objects are masked from Movie:\r## ## distributor, domestic_gross, genre, movie, mpaa_rating,\r## production_budget, release_date, worldwide_gross\r# check for missing values in numerical values\rsummary(release_date)\r## Length Class Mode ## 36 character character\rsummary(production_budget)\r## Min. 1st Qu.

Datasets are uploaded every tuesday, and plots are published under the #tidytuesday. This is just me presenting a few accumulated plots for the dataset r-downloads.csv and r_downloads_year.csv.\nI shall be focusing on the data set provided on 2018 October 30th, Which is R and Package download stats My main objective is to understand how Sri Lankan users have behaved in in this dataset.\nThe packages used in R are ggplot2, lubridate, ggthemr, gridExtra, magrittr, knitr and kableExtra.\nThere are 701 downloads occured in between the given time limit of 2017 october 20th to 2018 october 20th in Sri Lanka. Similarly, if we look at the downloads on the day of 2018 October 23rd, which is 3. There are 7 variables to be concerend, which are\n\rdate - date of download (y-m-d)\rtime - time of download (in UTC)\rsize - size in bytes\rversion - R release version\ros - Operating System\rcountry - Two letter ISO country code\rip_id - Anonymized dialy ip code(unique identifier)\r\r\rOperating Systems\rWindows is not a favourable operating system for open source programming was my myth. Well, No longer I shall believe that if it is considering Sri Lankans and R programming.\n\r\rOperating System\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\rosx\r\r0.0371\r\r\r\rsrc\r\r0.0271\r\r\r\rwin\r\r0.9358\r\r\r\r\rMajority of users have used Windows which is 93.58%, while Mac users are represented with 3.71% and finally 2.71% from the source file. Next, focusing on the R versions downloaded.\n\rR versions\rVersions are updated regularly for R and a grand update occured on 2018 April for the version 3.5.0. Further, versions 3.4.3 and 3.4.4 were updated in the time gap considered. There are versions from 3.0.0 and higher for Sri Lankans. It is crucial to study this where we can understand how far does the user have knowledge about R and updating the version.\nTable shows that version 3.5.1 represents a 36.52% followed by version 3.4.3 of 27.96% and in the third place version 3.5.0 with 15.98%. Further, all downloads are occured for versions 3.0.0 or higher than it. People believed in 3.4.3 than 3.5.0, which could only mean that 3.4.3 was more stable for users requirements.\n\r\rR Version\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\r3.0.0\r\r0.0014\r\r\r\r3.2.2\r\r0.0014\r\r\r\r3.4.0\r\r0.0014\r\r\r\r3.3.3\r\r0.0029\r\r\r\r3.4.1\r\r0.0029\r\r\r\r3.4.4\r\r0.0899\r\r\r\r3.4.2\r\r0.0956\r\r\r\r3.5.0\r\r0.1598\r\r\r\r3.4.3\r\r0.2796\r\r\r\r3.5.1\r\r0.3652\r\r\r\r\rIf we further divide the operating systems bar plot with respective to R version it is clearly seen that only versions 3.5.1, 3.5.0, 3.4.4, 3.4.3 and 3.4.2 have maintained importance for the windows operating system.\nContingency table for R version vs Operating System\r\r\r\r\r3.0.0\r\r3.2.2\r\r3.3.3\r\r3.4.0\r\r3.4.1\r\r3.4.2\r\r3.4.3\r\r3.4.4\r\r3.5.0\r\r3.5.1\r\r\r\r\r\rosx\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0029\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0100\r\r0.0086\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0071\r\r0.0086\r\r\r\rsrc\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0029\r\r0.0043\r\r0.0057\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0100\r\r\r\rwin\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0014\r\r0.0000\r\r0.0813\r\r0.2653\r\r0.0899\r\r0.1512\r\r0.3466\r\r\r\r\rWindows operating percentages indicate that 34.66% of users have choosen version 3.5.1, 26.53% have choosen version 3.4.3 and finally version 3.5.0 with 15.12%. Close to 9% is represented by version 3.4.2 and 3.4.4.\n\rDate versus Operating System\rDate is a difficult variable in statistics therefore I have dissemininated the date into 4 types, which are month(January to December), day(1-31), hour(0-23) and minutes(0-59). Further, I have tried to understand what type of operating systems were used in the time perspective.\nSo, the first sub part of time is months. Here, we are considering 12 months of an year and months August and April reflects a no OS better than Windows property. While, August holding the least amount of downloads with slightly above frequency 20. Highest percentage occurs to October with count higher than 130 and significantly osx and src types of files also have higher amount than anyother month. Except this only the month of december has counts higher than 100.\nNext, focusing on the days it is clear that 10th and 11th have most downloads respectively reaching more than 60 and 70 in counts, while in other days it mostly less than 30%. Further, clearly on the 31st it includes less than frequency of 10 because 31st is not a part of all 12 months. It would be very tiring to focus on operating systems individually, but to be fair there is clear sign of few days with only the use of windows, and a few days with combination of other operating systems with windows.\nI have been curious at this part because of wanting to know at which hour of the day did our Sri Lankan users download R. Yet it should be noted that the hour of time could be local time of Sri Lanka or otherwise. Still according to the bar chart the hours 4 and 5 have most downloads with counts of above 80 and above 90 respectively. where in the 21st hour it reaches a very low amount of less than 5 counts. Most of the frequencies are in the range of 10 and 50.\nLooking at the minutes it is very spread out. Focusing on special occasions only four minutes which are 59, 46, 12 and 0 have counts more than 20. While 51st minute has a count of 2. Rather than this nothing more significant occurs here. I think considering these counts in perspective of specific operating systems is tedious amount of work and waste of time.\n\rDownload Size and IP ID\rPackages were downloaded but none of their names were given in this dataset. Therefore we cannot know which package was downloaded. Yet we can identify the package sizes which were downloaded most. According to the table an R package with 82375220 bytes has most downloaded of 50, while second place goest to a size of 82375219 bytes and finally in third place is for 82375216 bytes with 39 counts.\n\r\rSize\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\r82877772\r\r18\r\r\r\r78171328\r\r22\r\r\r\r82375216\r\r39\r\r\r\r82375219\r\r48\r\r\r\r82375220\r\r50\r\r\r\r\rLooking at the IP ID it is clear that 334 has the highest downloads of 55, while second place goes to 1060 with 46 downloads. Finally, ID nunber 1286 has 16 downloads with third place.\n\r\rIP ID\r\rFrequency\r\r\r\r\r\r623\r\r9\r\r\r\r157\r\r12\r\r\r\r1286\r\r16\r\r\r\r1060\r\r46\r\r\r\r334\r\r55\r\r\r\r\r\rConclusion\rI shall conclude my findings in point form\n\rMost of Sri lankans (93.58%) use windows as a OS for R downloads\n\rTop three R versions are 3.5.1, 3.4.3 and 3.5.0 with percentages respectively 36.52% 27.96% and 15.98%.\n\rWindows users use versions 3.5.1, 3.4.3 and 3.5.0 with percentages 34.56%, 26.53% and 3.5.0.\n\rMost of the downloads occur in the months October and December, while days are 10th and 11th, while hours are 3rd and 4th and minutes of 59th, 46th, 12th and 0th.\n\rDownload size of 82375220 bytes happens with the highest count of 50, while the IP ID of 334 has most downloads of 55.\n\r\rPlease see that This is my first post on the internet so please be kind to tolerate my mistakes in grammar and spellings.

Rather than the CRAN or GitHub  versions, which only provides a manual in the website there are clear and concise examples of how functions can be used for researchers","tags":["package","R","CRAN","fitODBOD","GitHub","Website"],"title":"Website-fitODBOD: fitting Over Dispersed Binomial Outcome Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amalan Mahendran"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536969600,"objectID":"65a60044eeb2d2c5c9baaf4583c37a9a","permalink":"/publication/fitodbod-github/","publishdate":"2018-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fitodbod-github/","section":"publication","summary":" GitHub version is there for version 1.2.0 with is maintained by me if issues are raised regarding the package.

Modeling such data relative to Binomial Mixture Distributions were discussed because Binomial distribution fails to model the data. The reason is actual observed variance of the data is greater than the assumed theoretical variance, which is defined as over dispersion. fitODBOD package has two versions until October 2018, but in the future there will be updates regularly each year. Whenever there are new distributions to model BOD the new versions will include these distributions. Further, if there are new techniques to make these distributions more useful they will be also added as functions. Version 1.1.0 was published in February 2018 and Version 1.20 was released in September 2018 with two new distributions.","tags":["package","R","CRAN","fitODBOD"],"title":"CRAN-fitODBOD: fitting Over Dispersed Binomial Outcome Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.
