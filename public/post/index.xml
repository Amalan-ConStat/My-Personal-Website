      <description>How to find your R package is simply a blog post helping people to provide a list of websites. This websites were useful for me while developing my own package fitODBODto be sure that it is a unique package and to choose what my functions should be able to do.
This is a list with 16 items
1. GoogleWhen you have no idea to find a package first thing is to “Google”.</description>
