      <description>What I posted in #TidyTuesday on 13th November 2018.Below is the code and simple analysis I posted in relative to the Malaria data. I only focused on Sri Lanka and Malaria deaths over years. I could not find anything else at that time, but over the days I realized it should be worth to see how death counts change with different regions which do not have Code for the data sets malaria deaths and malaria deaths of age.</description>

      <description>Movie Profit, Not So ProfitThis is my second post on Tidy Tuesday and the data-set in question is Movie profit data-set. Even though the title of data says Movie profit I am going to focus on the movies which did not generate any revenue domestic and suggest on gross in worldwide.
The packages that I have used here are magrittr, tidyverse, scales, ggthemr, knitr, kableExtra, ggthemr and lubridate.</description>

      <description>IntroductionTidy Tuesday is a very good move to improve R programming for anyone who is interested in statistics. Data-sets are uploaded every Tuesday, and plots are published under the #tidytuesday. This is just me presenting a few accumulated plots for the data-set r-downloads.csv and r_downloads_year.csv.
I shall be focusing on the data set provided on 2018 October 30th, Which is R and Package download stats. My main objective is to understand how Sri Lankan users have behaved in this data-set.</description>
