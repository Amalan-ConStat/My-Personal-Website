<h1>What I posted in #TidyTuesday on 13th November 2018.</h1>
<p>Below is the code and simple analysis I posted in relative to the Malaria data. I only focused on Sri Lanka and Malaria deaths over years. I could not find anything else at that time, but over the days I realized it should be worth to see how death rate counts change with different regions which do not have Code variable assigned for the data sets malaria deaths and malaria deaths of age.</p>

<li>Malaria_deaths_plot: Plot shows the death rate per 100,000 people in Sri Lanka decreasing rapidly from 1996 to 2003 with a drop of 0.89 to 0.24, and by 2016 it reaches 0. While in 2015 this rate is 0.13. Highest death rate was in 1990 with 0.91.</li>

<h1>SDI Countries with Malaria Death Count Rate</h1>
<p>Initially there are 5 sub parts in SDI countries, but we can factor them into three based on their death rate behavior. Some regions are having higher death rate close to 75, while others have lower death rate close to 0.0002.</p>
<p>First group is the sub regions which are having higher death rates than other SDI regions, which are Low SDI and Low-middle SDI countries. Low SDI countries are behaving poorly from 1990 with a 73.78 death rate which reaches it highest peek of 75.88 in 2001 after this death rate gradually declines until 2016 and reaches 37.87.</p>
<p>This is not the case for Low middle SDI countries where in 1990 death rate is 19.11 and reaches its peek of 22.01 in 2003 with small fluctuations. After this it gradually and slowly declines until 2016 while finishing in a rate of 15.7.</p>

<p>SDI countries Middle and High-middle are performing better than the above two regions from 1990 itself. While Middle SDI countries have a very low death rate of close to 1 and periodically it decreases to 0.6 at 2016.

<p>If we do plot all these 5 sub parts of SDI countries on one plot we would not have seen these differences and even if we do use facet grid this is not possible. Therefore, first I did plot all 5 regions together and then sub setted them based on their death rate change in values.</p>
<p>It is clear that High SDI values have the lowest death rate and Low, Low middle SDI have the highest death rates over the years 1990 to 2016.</p>

<h1>Saharan Region with Malaria Death Count Rate</h1>
<p>There are 5 sub parts for Saharan region countries, which are Central Sub-Saharan, Eastern Sub-Saharan, Southern Sub-Saharan, Western Sub-Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Here though it does not look like we need to separate these regions and plot them as groups. While plotting them as a whole they are clear and possible to interpret the differences in this line plot.</p>
<p>Central Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Sub-Saharan Africa countries behave similarly where they start with death rates respectively 108.67, 118.94. Further this death rate increases and reaches its highest peaks of 138.23 and 121.08 respectively for Western Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Sub-Saharan Africa countries for the year 2003. Finally they decrease into their lowest of 64.64 death rate for Central Sub-Saharan Africa and 87.54 death rate for Western Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa Regions has a higher death rate performance through out the time line when it begins with 89.33 in 1990, and reaches its highest value of 96.28 in 2003. Further death rate decreases slowly up-to 51.93 in 2016, which is the least minimum value. Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa starts with 77.83 in 1990 and reaches its peak of 78.49 in 1991. In the next few years until 2000 there is small fluctuations. Finally there is a steep slope and reaches its lowest death rate value of 23.15 in 2016.</p>
<p>Death rate of Southern Sub-Saharan Africa is completely different than above four sub regions of Saharan Africa. In 1990 the death rate is 1.69 and it fluctuates until 2016, but it reaches the highest death rate of 2.57 in 2006. Further with this fluctuation in 2016 the death rate is 2.29 which is higher than the previous 7 years from 2016.</p>

<p>North Africa and Middle East region is the only odd region of all in this data set for malaria death rate. In year 1990 the death rate is 0.7968 but in the coming years it increases until 2005 and reaches 1.3444. Despite this increment after 2005 the death rate suddenly and rapidly drops until year 2011 and reaches its lowest point of 0.731.

</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I shall conclude my findings in point form</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Death rate for malaria decreases over the years with small fluctuations over the years and reaches zero in 2016 for Sri Lanka. By 2016 all age categories reach a death count of zero, but in 1990 they are at different parts of the scale.</p></li>
<li><p>High SDI countries have a low death rate. While Low and Low middle SDI countries have the highest death rates over the years from 1990 to 2016.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Saharan region lowest death rate is for Southern Sub-Saharan region and highest death rate is for Western Sub-Saharan region on the year 2016. This order is same for year 1990 as well in these regions. Highest death rate of all years and all sub regions occurs in year 2003 of 138.23 for Western Sub-Saharan Africa. While lowest death rate of all years and all sub regions is in year 1994 for Southern Sub-Saharan Africa with 1.55.</p></li>
<li><p>European and Great Britain related regions have no malaria related incidents over the years of 1990 to 2016, this could be because of their cold climate pattern and their developed status in the world.</p></li>
<li><p>North America shows figures of no malaria related deaths over the years of 1990 to 2016. Southern Latin America has the lowest death rate of 0.0035 in 2016 and highest death rate is for Central Latin America. But in year 1990 highest death rate is for Andean Latin American region which is 0.354 and least death rate is for Southern Latin America with 0.0208.</p></li>
<li><p>Australasia has no death rate over the years of 1990 to 2016. Where in year 2016 lowest death rate occurs to High Income Asia Pacific of 0.0008 and highest in that year for Oceania region with a value of 8.71. In the year 1990 highest death rate is for Oceania region with 14.78 but lowest is for High Income Asia Pacific region with 0.0073. A special occurrence where comparing all the regions and years the highest death rate is for Oceania Region in year 2000.</p></li>
<li><p>Highest death rate occurs in year 2005 for North Africa and Middle East region, but in 1990 the malaria death rate is 0.7968. Further in 2011 it hits the lowest value of 0.731 and finally moves up-to 0.8332 in year 2016.</p></li>
<li><p>In year 1990 Caribbean region has a lower death rate than Latin American and Caribbean region. But this gap gradually decreases over time and by year 2016 Caribbean region reaches a death rate of 0.058 while Latin America and Caribbean region occupies the rate of 0.0468.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="further-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>Further Analysis</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>This article only focuses on the death rate but we can expand it to countries and compare them over continents.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible to consider the age category and compare the death counts of different regions to understand further of these regions.</p></li>
