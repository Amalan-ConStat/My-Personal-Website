      <description>More than 50 TV shows are on my list and I have watched all of them. There are alot of shows in this list where all would agree be great and enticing. There is no specific genre of my interest and I do not mind re-watching these TV shows again.

      <description>I started reading books from month of April, 2018. Which is very useful for my life as a believer of self-learning. I hope to share these books with you so that it will be useful. There is no meaning in numbers except that they are just for ordering from 1 to further in no hierarchy. Genre specificity is not my thing therefore these books are not divided into groups.</description>

They are from different decades as well, therefore do not hesitate to watch. If you prefer go through the IMDB link so that the ratings and summary will give you more information.
