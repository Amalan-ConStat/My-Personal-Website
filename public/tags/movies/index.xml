      <description>Movie Profit, Not So ProfitThis is my first post on Tidy Tuesday and the data-set in question is Movie profit data-set. Even though the title of data says Movie profit I am going to focus on the movies which did not generate any revenue domestic and suggest on gross in worldwide.
The packages that I have used here are magrittr, tidyverse, scales, ggthemr, knitr, kableExtra, ggthemr and lubridate. The theme I am using for plots is “flat dark”.</description>

      <description>Watching movies for the last six years(from 2012) with much interest in plot, story line and characters. I have watched more than 300 movies but the below mentioned are in my mind. They are from different decades as well, therefore do not hesistate to watch. If you prefer go through the IMDB link so that the ratings and summary will give you more information. 36 Movies will be mentioned below.</description>
