      <description>IntroductionTidy Tuesday is a very good move to improve R programming for anyone who is interested in statistics. Datasets are uploaded every tuesday, and plots are published under the #tidytuesday. This is just me presenting a few accumulated plots for the dataset r-downloads.csv and r_downloads_year.csv.
I shall be focusing on the data set provided on 2018 October 30th, Which is R and Package download stats My main objective is to understand how Sri Lankan users have behaved in in this dataset.</description>
