      <description>What I posted in #TidyTuesday on 13th November 2018.Below is the code and simple analysis I posted in relative to the Malaria data. I only focused on Sri Lanka and Malaria deaths over years. I could not find anything else at that time, but over the days I realized it should be worth to see how death rate counts change with different regions which do not have Code variable assigned for the data sets malaria deaths and malaria deaths of age.</description>

      <description>IntroductionTidy Tuesday is a very good move to improve R programming for anyone who is interested in statistics. Data-sets are uploaded every Tuesday, and plots are published under the #tidytuesday. This is just me presenting a few accumulated plots for the data-set r-downloads.csv and r_downloads_year.csv.
I shall be focusing on the data set provided on 2018 October 30th, Which is R and Package download stats. My main objective is to understand how Sri Lankan users have behaved in this data-set.</description>

      <description>Movie Profit, Not So ProfitThis is my first post on Tidy Tuesday and the data-set in question is Movie profit data-set. Even though the title of data says Movie profit I am going to focus on the movies which did not generate any revenue domestic and suggest on gross in worldwide.
The packages that I have used here are magrittr, tidyverse, scales, ggthemr, knitr, kableExtra, ggthemr and lubridate. The theme I am using for plots is “flat dark”.</description>
