      <description>Bridge Data and BaltimoreData for the analysis and description about the Baltimore bridges are hyper-linked. Further , my tweet is also in this hyperlink.
Data on bridges is of week 35 from TidyTuesday. Trying to explain the data using maps is obvious, yet I will use animated jitter plots. There are 13 variables and 2079 observations. Brave choice of limiting my self to less than 10 variables, where latitude, longitude and Vehicles will not be taken into account.</description>

      <description>Data set was provided on week 34 for TidyTuesday analysis. As it is Thanksgiving week this is understandable. You can receive the data set here. There are more than 65 variables and 1058 observations. The data was acquired buy a survey conducted online and information about them are here.

      <title>Week 33 : Malaria Deaths</title>

      <description>What I posted in #TidyTuesday on 13th November 2018.Below is the code and simple analysis I posted in relative to the Malaria data. I only focused on Sri Lanka and Malaria deaths over years. I could not find anything else at that time, but over the days I realized it should be worth to see how death rate counts change with different regions which do not have Code variable assigned for the data sets malaria deaths and malaria deaths of age.</description>

      <title>Week 30: Movie Profit</title>

      <description>Movie Profit, Not So ProfitThis is my first post on Tidy Tuesday and the data-set in question is Movie profit data-set. Even though the title of data says Movie profit I am going to focus on the movies which did not generate any revenue domestic and suggest on gross in worldwide.
The packages that I have used here are magrittr, tidyverse, scales, ggthemr, knitr, kableExtra, ggthemr and lubridate. The theme I am using for plots is “flat dark”.</description>
