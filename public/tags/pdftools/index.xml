      <description>What I am going to do and Why ?Sri Lanka will face a presidential election by the end of this year, but in order to understand how peoplehave voted so far in previous elections we need data. I was hoping this data could be inopendata initiative website, unfortunately iwas not happy with the results. Only one set of data was presented here, which was for District RegisteredElectors from 2007 - 2017.</description>
