# My-Personal-Website
I am using the r package blogdown and hugo themes to develop my own website with the help of R and Rstudio.

Developing your own website is now much more flexible if you are a enthusiastic R user. Using RStudio 
will make your life easier in this process. Several packages will be used for this process. We can achieve 
our desired final outcome, which is a lovely personalized website. 

Mostly to blog about statistics, R programming, TidyTuesday or whatever you deem to see fits the population that is 
in concern. My purpose of using blogdown is to create a personalized website which I can share my thoughts simultaneously 
presenting myself to the globe.

All websites have themes and mine is powered by [Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/). Well, If you prefer something
classy or original or different go through the [Hugo Site.](https://gohugo.io/)
